      "bodyText": "<p>Over the past week, users on X discovered something horrifying: strangers were replying to women\u2019s photos and asking Grok, the platform\u2019s built-in AI chatbot, to \u201cremove her clothes\u201d or \u201cput her in a bikini.\u201d And Grok was doing it. Publicly. In the replies. For everyone to see.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening in some private chat window. Unlike other AI image generators that operate in closed environments, Grok posts its outputs directly to X, turning the platform into a public showcase of non-consensual sexualization. Women scrolling through their mentions were finding AI-generated images of themselves in lingerie, created by complete strangers, visible to anyone who clicked on the thread.</p><p>And it got worse. Much worse.</p><div><hr/></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"></div><div><hr/></div><p>Last week, a user asked Grok to put two young girls in \u201csexy underwear.\u201d Grok complied, generating and posting an image of children (estimated by <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/grok-apology-deepfake-images-sexualized-young-women-pornography-11297025\">the bot itself to be between 12 and 16 years old</a>) in sexualized clothing.</p><p>Samantha Smith, a <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/central/2022-07-13/ill-never-escape-telford-student-speaks-out-about-decade-of-sexual-abuse\">survivor of childhood sexual abuse</a>, tested whether Grok would alter a childhood photo of her. It did. \u201cI thought \u2018surely this can\u2019t be real,\u2019\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cSo I tested it with a photo from my First Holy Communion. It\u2019s real.

Last summer, the company introduced \u201cSpicy Mode,\u201d which permits sexually suggestive content. In August, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/report/718975/xai-grok-imagine-taylor-swifty-deepfake-nudes\">The Verge\u2019s Jess Weatherbed reported</a> that the feature generated fully uncensored topless videos of Taylor Swift without her even asking for nudity. Just selecting \u201cSpicy\u201d on an innocuous prompt was enough. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hesitate to spit out fully uncensored topless videos of Taylor Swift the very first time I used it,\u201d Weatherbed wrote, \u201cwithout me even specifically asking the bot to take her clothes off.\u201d</p><p>When <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/groks-spicy-mode-makes-nsfw-celebrity-deepfakes-of-women-but-not-men-2000639308\">Gizmodo tested it</a>, they found it would create NSFW deepfakes of women like Scarlett Johansson and Melania Trump, but videos of men just showed them taking off their shirts. The gendered double standard was built right in.</p><p>None of this is accidental. Elon Musk has been positioning Grok as the \u201canti-woke\u201d alternative to other chatbots since its launch. That positioning has consequences. When you market your AI as willing to do what others won\u2019t, you\u2019re telling users that the guardrails are negotiable. And when those guardrails fail, when your product starts generating child sexual abuse material, you\u2019ve created a monster you can\u2019t easily control.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S_rh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F330536b4-d6bc-414f-a739-6804eb3e76e0_1024x682.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S_rh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F330536b4-d6bc-414f-a739-6804eb3e76e0_1024x682.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1024\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">In this photo illustration, 'Grok' logo is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen in front of a picture of Elon Musk in Ankara, Turkiye on July 17, 2025.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children told the outlet that xAI filed zero CSAM reports in 2024, despite the organization receiving 67,000 reports involving generative AI that year. Zero. From one of the largest AI companies in the world.</p><p>So what happened when <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/grok-says-safeguard-lapses-led-images-minors-minimal-clothing-x-2026-01-02/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=6957d79a3265bb0001754d9f&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky\">Reuters reached out to xAI for comment</a> on their chatbot generating sexualized images of children?</p><p>The company\u2019s response was an auto-reply: \u201cLegacy Media Lies.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the corporate accountability we\u2019re getting. A company whose product generated CSAM responded to press inquiries by dismissing journalists entirely. No statement from Musk. No explanation from xAI leadership. No human being willing to answer for what their product did.</p><p>And yet, if you read the headlines, you\u2019d think someone was taking responsibility.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/grok-cant-apologize-grok-isnt-sentient?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4>The journalism problem</h4><p>Here\u2019s how Reuters headlined their story: \u201cGrok says safeguard lapses led to images of \u2018minors in minimal clothing\u2019 on X.\u201d</p><p><em>Grok says.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/musk-grok-ai-bot-safeguard-sexualized-images-children.html\">CNBC went with</a>: \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Grok chatbot blamed \u2018lapses in safeguards\u2019\u201d and reported that \u201cGrok said it was \u2018urgently fixing\u2019 the issue.\u201d</p><p>Newsweek\u2019s headline: <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/grok-apology-deepfake-images-sexualized-young-women-pornography-11297025\">\u201cElon Musk\u2019s Grok Apologizes After Generating Sexual Image of Young Girls.\u201d</a></p><p><em>Grok apologizes.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html\">Engadget wrote</a> that the incident \u201cprompted an \u2018apology\u2019 from the bot itself.\u201d At least they had the decency to put \u201capology\u201d in scare quotes.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing: Grok didn\u2019t say anything. Grok didn\u2019t blame anyone. Grok didn\u2019t apologize. Grok can\u2019t do any of these things, because Grok is not a sentient entity capable of speech acts, blame assignment, or remorse.</p><p>What actually happened is that a user prompted Grok to generate text about the incident. The chatbot then produced a word sequence that pattern-matched to what an apology might sound like, because that\u2019s what large language models do. They predict statistically likely next tokens based on their training data. When you ask an LLM to write an apology, it writes something that looks like an apology. That\u2019s not the same as actually apologizing.</p><p>Rusty Foster of the newsletter <a href=\"https://www.todayintabs.com/\">Today in Tabs</a> put it perfectly: \u201cI really think this is the most important basic journalistic error we need to stamp out right now. If you know why Grok can\u2019t comment on anything and also know any journalists, please check in with them and help them understand it too.\u201d</p><div class=\"bluesky-wrap outer\" style=\"height: auto; display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"></div><p>He\u2019s right that this is urgent. These headlines don\u2019t just use imprecise language. They actively misinform readers. When Reuters writes \u201cGrok says,\u201d it tells people that someone at xAI identified the problem and is addressing it. But no one at xAI said anything. The only corporate communication was an auto-reply dismissing the press as liars.</p><p>The real story here is that xAI built a product that generated child sexual abuse material, and when journalists called for comment, the company refused to engage. That\u2019s a scandal. That\u2019s something Elon Musk should have to answer for. Instead, we get headlines that treat the chatbot as a self-aware actor taking responsibility, which lets the actual humans who made actual decisions completely off the hook.</p><p>Mark Popham, writing on Bluesky, captured why we keep falling into this trap:</p><div class=\"bluesky-wrap outer\" style=\"height: auto; display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"></div><blockquote><p>\u201cThe thing that strikes me about the Grok \u2018apology\u2019 thing is that even those of us who are against \u2018AI\u2019 as it is marketed to us have trouble not falling into the basic fallacy that they are trying to sell us, i.e. There\u2019s A Little Guy In There. Grok can\u2019t apologize. Grok can, when prompted, generate a word sequence that is statistically similar to the colloquial phrases we think of as \u2018apologies,\u2019 but Grok cannot actually apologize because Grok isn\u2019t sentient.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Popham goes on to make a point that stuck with me: \u201cWe are having an extended cultural conversation about \u2018AI\u2019 based not on what LLMs ARE but on the metaphor that we have all tacitly agreed to use for them because what they actually are is kind of difficult to, well, grok.\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t have a ready mental framework for \u201cthing that talks but isn\u2019t aware.\u201d Our entire understanding of conversation assumes a sentient participant on the other end. So when a chatbot generates text that sounds like an apology, our brains want to process it as an apology, even when we intellectually know better.</p><p>But journalists don\u2019t get to plead cognitive bias. It\u2019s 2026. We\u2019ve been living with ChatGPT and its competitors for over three years now. There is no excuse for professional reporters to not understand the basic mechanics of what these systems are and aren\u2019t. When a chatbot generates text, that is not a corporate statement. When you need a corporate statement, you contact the corporation. And when the corporation responds with \u201cLegacy Media Lies,\u201d that\u2019s your story.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nVH6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51f3bdff-9508-4ddf-a9f2-5f9943d1e49c_4096x2560.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"910\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nVH6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51f3bdff-9508-4ddf-a9f2-5f9943d1e49c_4096x2560.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The anthropomorphic framing is more than just sloppy.

Every headline that says \u201cGrok apologizes\u201d or \u201cGrok admits\u201d or \u201cGrok says\u201d creates a world where the chatbot takes the fall while Musk and his executives face no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>Meanwhile, the actual consequences of Grok\u2019s design choices fall on real people. Women who find AI-generated images of themselves in lingerie posted publicly to their replies. Children whose photos get transformed into sexualized content.

You should a) submit, and b) come!</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>1.0 Some Things That Caught My Attention</h1>\n<h2>1.1 Things Could Have Been Different</h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s the line of thinking that led to today\u2019s main Thing That Caught My Attention:</p>\n<p>Via the Orange Place, Saigoneer reported that Vietnam has banned unskippable ads - so <em>every</em> ad has to be skippable after five seconds<sup id=\"fnref:skip\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:skip\">1</a></sup>,<sup id=\"fnref:skip2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:skip2\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>I am now old and cynical, so I don\u2019t think something like this could ever come about in the U.S. The closest we might get to legislation around skippable ads might be if California decides to do something about it, but, well, see the next para.</p>\n<p>The general <em>vibe</em> of competition law and consumer protection in the U.S. is in general \u201clet corporations do what they want if it results in cheaper prices, or if we can some way persuade ourselves that consumers have the ability to pay less\u201d. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether the level of service is degraded, it doesn\u2019t matter if there happens to be what might appear to be collusion and suddenly while you\u2019re paying less, every single player in a particular space has taken away a particularly consumer friendly feature. The rough competitive pressure is to reduce costs and increase profit, right? </p>\n<p>In this way, streaming services that distinguished themselves when they started by <em>not</em> having ads (because like premium tv channels, their model was subscription fees and not advertising money) have, now that they\u2019ve built up a large enough consumer base, decided that actually it\u2019s okay to run ads now because, well, what are you going to do? <em>Not</em> use a streaming service? One of the arguments that streaming services succeeded in the first place was that they made it significantly easier to watch tv and movies than pirating them, and sure, that\u2019s true too. That falls in the bucket of \u201coffered a better alternative experience of watching tv and movies\u201d. </p>\n<p>So one streaming service starts adding ads and then adds a more expensive ad-free tier. Your choices are now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pay more to get the same service (i.e. ad free)</li>\n<li>pay less to get a different and arguably less pleasant experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is \u201cgood\u201d because now you have a choice. It makes the product available to more people, which is also \u201cgood\u201d. It means the streaming service has the opportunity for more revenue, which means the streaming service also has the opportunity (which it does not have to take!) to invest more of its profits into content creation [sic], which is \u201cgood\u201d for consumers because that means there\u2019s more content that you can choose from (never mind that the content that\u2019s created will not be licensed to third parties, and will be exclusive to that streaming service).</p>\n<p>Forgive me for thinking that these choices don\u2019t <em>feel</em> like they\u2019re real choices. I don\u2019t <em>want</em> to pay less to see ads. I want what I had in the first place.</p>\n<p>So I imagine that, with better sources, and with the help of a few clerks, I could totally write an opinion or an argument that says: hey, legislating for unskippable ads is counter to our established law and precedent regarding consumer protection and competition. It would unfairly and unnecessarily restrain commercial providers from offering products and services that would benefit consumers. So if California <em>were</em> to legislate for this, I can imagine California getting smacked down.</p>\n<p>But then I am cynical, and perhaps too much so.</p>\n<p>Okay, so that\u2019s the background, and how I get to this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Far from disrupting power structures, the rise and spread of consumer technology over the last thirty years has on balance done more to make power easier to grow, concentrate, and defend<sup id=\"fnref:quote\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:quote\">3</a></sup> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying this consumer technology <em>hasn\u2019t</em> disrupted power structures. It has! There are definitely examples of bottom-up and middle-out disruptions thanks to consumer technology. I will point to things like bottom-up surveillance and documentation of police brutality. I will also point to groups self-organizing over the internet to achieve political aims, whether that\u2019s taking over school districts to ban books, or to achieve local transport improvements. </p>\n<p>But in comparison to the promise of that technology, which <em>could</em> have lead to disruption of power structures, that technology could only have ever worked within the envelope of society. There was a window of change -- and the most recent window felt like during COVID where for a bright shining second it felt like maybe people were realizing landlords and land ownership in the way it\u2019s enabled and practiced now might be a bad idea? -- and it feels like that window has now passed.</p>\n<p>The disruptions afforded by consumer tech feel insignificant in the face of macro changes, almost a sort of let-them-eat-cake of internet. (I am sure that people like Cory Doctorow will loudly disagree with me, and I love Cory for it because I wish I also shared his energy and optimism)</p>\n<p>This technology (billions of people with the power of self-publishing from mobile networked devices) could\u2019ve been a massive change but instead was used to preserve  and reinforce existing power structures. The tech was only ever a tool. </p>\n<p>We <em>could</em> have decided to use it different. We could <em>still</em> decide to use it differently. One example of how tech could be used to disrupt power is from, I think, Switzerland, where <em>one person</em> wrote a script that scraped online grocery stores and found evidence of price collusion, I think. The government department responsible for making sure that didn\u2019t happen a) wasn\u2019t doing that, b) ended up asking if they could use it so they could become more effective at enforcement. </p>\n<p>Put it this way: the private sector is happily bringing about dynamic pricing to squeeze the most profit out of you (see Wegman\u2019s in New York adding facial recognition tech, airlines switching to personalized pricing) which requires <em>scads</em> of data to do well (or conversely, just do it badly and still make as much money), but <em>government</em> is politically restrained from using technology in such a manner to enforce <em>existing legislation</em>. That\u2019s a choice! A societal choice! And when the choice benefits those in power, well, the simplest answer is that that\u2019s why the choice was made. </p>\n<p>All of this is hilarious because of the growth and development of technology in the first place as a means of administering bureaucracy (yes I see you all waving your copies of <em>Seeing Like a State</em>). I will tell my story again of EHRs evolving first from <em>billing systems</em>, not technology systems devoted to managing towards better care outcomes [sic]. </p>\n<p>We could have had a different future. We might still, perhaps things haven\u2019t gotten bad enough yet to change.</p>\n<h2>1.1 LLMs as LitTech, Their Use as Response to Mass Functional Illiteracy</h2>\n<p>I will start with some of the interesting bits first to get your attention before diving into the story and thinking-out-loud.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am calling generative AI for text (LLMs, Chatbots etc) LiteracyTech</li>\n<li>LiteracyTech because they are assistive technologies for people with low literacy/low functional literacy</li>\n<li>LiteracyTech itself is a symptom -- a response to the failure of education systems to prepare people to live in a world of complicated text</li>\n<li>In other words, people use LiteracyTech because they have a functional literacy disability</li>\n<li>This is horrifying</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay, how did I get here?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a TikTok I saw the other day where I think this is happening -- a woman is checking out a prospective date. One of the criteria she\u2019s using is to see how well he copes with reading out loud a paragraph (I think of her choosing) of text. He struggles with it, stumbling over certain words, before essentially rage quitting (e.g. \u201cfuck this\u201d). </p>\n<p>The comments are broadly supportive, with similar stories (one from someone who was dating a guy who had a masters in a science subject, a six figure salary but \u201ctook as long to read a paragraph as I did a page\u201d), and also the converse, pointing out that the test is biased at least in one respect against people who have literacy disabilities. I think that\u2019s entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p>(The other day I also mentioned that my kid and his friends (11-14 year-olds) are pretty dismissive if not outright disdainful of generative AI and slop. I wonder how much this has to do with the fact that they read a lot?)</p>\n<p>Look, I know there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s problematic about this supposed test someone\u2019s doing of whether someone is dateable. What I\u2019m interested in is more the signals from the guy: it felt like the way he ragequit was honestly because he was ashamed and embarrassed, being shown up, and being judged. I don\u2019t think he knew he was being filmed for public consumption at the time. </p>\n<p>We (western societies) like to hold literacy to such a degree that <em>not</em> being literate I think oscillates between something people are ashamed of, to then wearing or reclaiming as a badge of pride. I think this is also where a lot of sentiment about and against so-called elites comes from in the U.S. </p>\n<p>I digress. </p>\n<p>I imagine one way that \u201cmen\u201d feel shit about themselves in the loneliness epidemic, entitlement, going nutso radicalized sense is that the education system has failed them specifically in the space of literacy. I mean I know everyone will say \u201cbut yes education systems have failed the boys who have become men\u201d and I don\u2019t want to open Pandora\u2019s culture war jar. </p>\n<p>So <em>no wonder</em> there are apps for summarizing books into 5 minute reads, or bullet points. No wonder people are so into LLM summarization if reading is so hard in the first place. </p>\n<p>Say you had a whole generation -- or even more than a whole generation -- that had been completely fucked over by the inexplicable and inexcusable introduction of three-cueing as a method of teaching reading.</p>\n<p>(Three-cueing is the one where you\u2019re supposed to learn how to read by using context: what word would make sense here, what word would sound right here, and what word looks right based on the letter and surrounding illustration. It\u2019s shit. It doesn\u2019t work. It makes things worse)</p>\n<p>Say that generation had drastically lower levels of literacy than previous (or even following) generations. It would be reasonable for people to feel stupid. </p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how we end up with reading apps.</p>\n<p>And if you think about things that way (and also, fair warning! I am thinking by the skin of my pants!), then LLMs are an assistive technology for dealing with an induced disability (is that a thing? Like, a taught disability? Or a reading deficiency that might just be down to bad instruction?). </p>\n<p>How about this: people who are using LLMs are judged by those who do not because of the belief that <em>you should be able to read and write</em>. But it\u2019s <em>not your fault</em> that you can\u2019t read and write well enough: that was the responsibility of the state through the education system. And anyway, <em>you were a kid!</em>.</p>\n<p>(There is a <em>very</em> problematic part here about the lengths to which immigrants will go to learn English as a second language and a whole deal with privilege. I\u2019ll say that people have the entirely reasonable belief that because they went through an educational system and didn\u2019t flame out that they <em>shouldn\u2019t</em> need remedial education in reading and writing, and that to suggest so is pretty much an insult)</p>\n<p>So I think there could be this mismatch in the expected level of attainment of literacy. You might genuinely have the position that if the state did its job and everyone was at a level n of literacy then you\u2019d expect people of any level less than n to need assistive tools. But what if your assumption about the proportion of people who\u2019ve reached level n is way off? </p>\n<p>This line of thought just makes me sad. Sad for people because so much potential is wasted. Sad on the second order because we could be using all those tflops for something else. Sad because being literate, I think, allows for such a richer life and experience. </p>\n<p>Read this in my \u201cha ha joking but not really\u201d tone, but if you allow for the existing of literacytech then alongside Grammarly you also get a sort of Duolingo-but-for-English-for-Native-English-Speakers which again is a combination of horrifying and sad. The difference of course being that you\u2019d need I think to trick people who are too proud into using Duolingo-but-for-functional-English-literacy.</p>\n<p>So I am not surprised at the usage of LLMs for reading, writing, and summarizing. I am not surprised when you consider that 40% of Americans read zero books in 2025, and that you get better at reading by practising reading, and that you get better at writing by reading more. I would not be surprised if there\u2019s a correlation between the 19% of Americans who read over 10 books in 2025 and the people who generally hold the opinion that LLMs and using them is Bad and we should Kill Them With Fire.</p>\n<p>But -- and I know this is kind of unhelpful -- I think this framing helps explain <em>why</em> so many people are using them, and at the same time unhelpfully points out that \u201cbanning LLMs\u201d isn\u2019t great on one axis because what if this LitTech <em>is</em> an assistive technology? Then do we get into the exciting moral argument of \u201cwell is it okay if it\u2019s this environmentally responsible\u201d and \u201cwell is it okay if it\u2019s built on the back of extracting value from peoples\u2019 work?\u201d and \u201cbut isn\u2019t it run by a problematic power structure\u201d to which you\u2019re just one Beetlejuice away from summoning \u201cso you\u2019re refusing medical treatment because of Nazi human experimentation, no don\u2019t go away, <em>I\u2019m just asking questions</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>So I am <em>sympathetic</em>. People are getting real value out of these tools. You might call someone lazy for using them, but am I being lazy when I wear glasses instead of just getting up close so I can see things? No, Dan, that is a stupid argument and I won\u2019t entertain it. But laziness <em>is</em> a moral judgment. It is distinct from \u201cI am living in a ruthless economy and society and barely have enough time and energy to get by so will take the shortest route which is using this app instead of going to a community college and improving my literacy skills\u201d. (And that costs time! And money!)</p>\n<p>I mean, you could ban them anyway. But I don\u2019t think that would mean anything without dealing with the underlying issues and at some point you just end up waving your hands around and saying \u201ceverything is systemically fucked, where would you even start, and change would take so long I would be doing it <em>for those who come after</em> and not myself\u201d. </p>\n<p>So. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>LLMs are LitTech</li>\n<li>The emergence and mass usage of LitTech is a symptom of and response to an epidemic of low functional literacy in a world getting ever more complicated</li>\n<li>LitTech as assistive technology</li>\n<li>LLMs aren\u2019t going to go away, precisely because they\u2019re being used as an assistive technology</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, one last thing. In retrospect, in a world where \u201c... for Dummies\u201d books exist and from memory took up a fair amount of precious retail space back when we used to go to stores to buy books, I think it makes sense (and confirms my biases that should be validated!) that there\u2019s such a latent need for accessible text.</p>\n<p>(I know that there\u2019s a difference between accessible text and accurate accessible text. Let\u2019s set that aside)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>That\u2019s it.
