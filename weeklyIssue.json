      "bodyText": "<p><strong>This Week:\u00a0 </strong>Disney just licensed more than 200 of its most valuable IP to OpenAI\u2019s Sora platform.  Didn\u2019t they learn anything from the failed Maker Studios acquisition? </p>\n<p>Also, this is the last newsletter for 2025. Look for my \u201cPrediction-ala-palooza on Monday Jan 5th. And look for ME at the 1 Billion Followers Summit later that week, as I\u2019m producing/programming the Economy Track!</p>\n<p>Hello Friends!\u00a0 I\u2019m <strong>Jim Louderback</strong> and this is my weekly creator economy newsletter. If you\u2019ve received it, then you are either subscribed, or someone forwarded it to you.\u2028 If the latter \u2013 and you want to subscribe, <a href=\"https://insidethecreator.beehiiv.com/subscribe\">get it here</a>!</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TOP STORIES</strong></h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>FANDOM WINS</strong></h3>\n<p>Disney just announced a $1B equity investment in OpenAI and a three-year licensing deal that brings 200+ Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars characters into Sora. Some fan-made shorts will even show up on Disney+. This is the next logical step in the creator economy\u2019s evolution from Who to What to You. I wrote about that shift in October: YouTube focused on WHO you liked (creator graph), TikTok owned the topic graph, and now Sora puts you into the video. Expect a flood of fan-fic video stories inspired in part by Kingdom Hearts, whose protagonist is (coincidentally and conveniently) named Sora.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the right move, but I\u2019m still trepidatious. We\u2019ve been down this road before.\u00a0 Disney tried a version of this in 2014 when it bought Maker Studios, betting it could unleash YouTubers on Disney IP. Doomed in part by Maker producing a dozen+ episodes of a Star-Wars related reality show, which allegedly never aired because Maker neglected to vet it with either Disney or Lucas\u2019 brand police.</p>\n<p>OpenAI says it will implement \u201crobust controls.\u201d Disney says, \u201cresponsible use.\u201d We\u2019ll see how that goes, because OpenAI\u2019s guardrails have historically been\u2026 interesting. Either way, Stinky Pete, Roz, and I are going to have an amazing time until it all comes crumbling down.

And by formally labeling the Oracle and Silver Lake deal a \u201cqualified divestiture,\u201d the Trump administration effectively defanged the original bill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>China still hasn\u2019t signed off\u2026 and President Xi\u2019s approval remains the real gate.\u00a0 That leaves TikTok with 38 days before *something* needs to happen. Another extension perhaps?\u00a0 Congressional action is theoretically possible, but in today\u2019s climate, that seems unlikely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have been under the wrong assumption over the past few weeks that this Tuesday was the hard deadline.\u00a0 But until the Oracle and Silver Lake deal is consummated, TikTok US remains in a state of interruptus.\u00a0 My clock has been updated accordingly.\u00a0 (<a href=\"http://tiktokcountdownclock.com/\">TikTok Countdown Clock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance/\">CBS News</a>)</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BEASTLY MISTAKE</strong></h3>\n<p>Another correction from last week. My journalist mole at DealBook misled me. Beast Industries CEO Jeffrey Housenbold wasn\u2019t late. He was backstage the whole time. Sorry. Late or not, it was still awkward on stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Survivor and the Beast:</strong> <em>Beast Games</em> season two includes a crossover with <em>Survivor</em>, co-hosted by Jeff Probst and Jimmy Donaldson. This could be electric. It could also be awkward. The subtitle is \u201cSmart vs. Strong,\u201d presumably because \u201cBrains vs. Brawn\u201d was already taken by both <em>Survivor Australia </em>and<em> Survivor US </em>(which added on \u201c<em>vs.</em> <em>Beauty)</em>.\u00a0 Perhaps season 3 will be Smart vs. Strong vs. Sultry?</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PINTEREST PREDICTS 2026</strong></h3>\n<p>I always love the annual Pinterest predictions, in part because they are usually right (they claim an 88% hit rate), and in part because they are just so fun.\u00a0 This year\u2019s report includes 21 \u201cnot yet trending\u201d aesthetics, including Glamoratti (maximalist 80s), Gimme Gummy (tactile, rubberized, 3D looks), Pen Pals (snail mail revival), Glitchy Glam (deliberate imperfection), and Cabbage Crush (yes, cabbage as a main character).\u00a0 I, for one, love Khaki Coded because that\u2019s basically my entire wardrobe \u2013 props to @Scott Jordan\u2019s ScottEVest for finally becoming haute couture!\u00a0 (<a href=\"https://business.pinterest.com/pinterest-predicts/\">Pinterest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scottevest.com/\">SCOTTeVEST</a>)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/my-pinterest-predicts-page-2.jpg?resize=560%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"560\"/></figure></div>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PREDICTIONS, TRENDS and SIGNALS</strong></h3>\n<p>Speaking of predictions, you\u2019ve probably been inundated with them.\u00a0 You won\u2019t see mine until January 5<sup>th</sup>, as I\u2019m taking the next two weeks off.\u00a0 As usual I\u2019ll focus on trends that will define 2026, along with key patterns and signals driving the future of the creator economy in 2027 and beyond.</p>\n<p>I gave myself a B+ last January for my 2024 predictions.\u00a0 This year I asked my friends Gemini and ChatGPT to rate my\u00a0 50 signals, predictions and trends for 2025.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gemini gave me an 8/10 score for my <a href=\"https://insidethecreator.beehiiv.com/p/25-mega-trends-for-2025\">creator economy predictions</a>, 9/10 for my <a href=\"https://insidethecreator.beehiiv.com/p/bye-bye-ai\">AI predictions</a> and 9/10 for my <a href=\"https://insidethecreator.beehiiv.com/p/ghost-hunting\">2026 and beyond</a> signals \u2013 and an overall score of 9/10.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty darn good.\u00a0 My biggest misses?\u00a0 Creators Disrupt Education and the Rise of Prediction Markets.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t hit the way I thought in 2025 \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to read 2026\u2019s newsletter to see if I\u2019m doubling down.\u00a0 Oh, and Gemini suggested that I \u201cbuy a lottery ticket\u201d, because \u201cAlmost every \u2018creepy\u2019 signal you tracked has accelerated faster than anticipated.\u201d\u00a0 It also suggested that for next year I \u201cthink weirder\u201d.\u00a0 Challenge accepted!</p>\n<p>ChatGPT, on the other hand, probably thought Gemini graded on a curve.\u00a0 It marked me down to 8/10, saying I was \u201cconsistently right on Direction, and a bit less right on Magnitude.\u201d\u00a0 It advised me to \u201ckeep the bold call\u201d but hedge it with wishy washy words.\u00a0 I\u2019ll take that under advisement.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em><strong>SPONSOR</strong></em></h2>\n<p>LinkedIn\u2019s <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/b2b-institute/easy-to-find-being-where-b2b-buying-happens\">new B2B Buyer Report</a> makes the case better than I ever could: buyers trust expert voices more than brands, and they spend most of their research time reading the people who actually understand the space.

In the future, everyone gets their own podcast. New research from Sounds Profitable and Signal Hill Insights says we\u2019re already headed there, as 1 in 6 podcast listeners have tried making their own.\u00a0 They also reinforced the inexorable trend towards video with 71% of podcasters doing some form of video.\u00a0 Also, the churn is real. About a third of would-be podcasters have already quit, which creates a surprisingly big untapped market.\u00a0 One more encouraging signal: podcasting looks like it\u2019s getting healthier and more diverse. There\u2019s still a gender gap in who starts, but once people do, retention is basically equal. And multicultural creators appear to stick around and succeed at higher rates overall. (<a href=\"https://soundsprofitable.com/research/the-creators-2025/\">Sounds Profitable</a>)</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Everyone Is a Creator Now, And Commerce Is Tagging Along</strong></h3>\n<p>@Dan Frommer\u2019s latest consumer research has a useful reminder for anyone building in the creator economy. \u201cCreator\u201d is no longer a job title. It\u2019s normal consumer behavior, especially for Gen Z and Millennials. Nearly half self-identify as creators, mostly \u201cfor fun,\u201d and three quarters say it\u2019s a viable career, even though only a small minority will ever turn it into reliable income.\u00a0 Frommer\u2019s research is U.S.-only, but based on my conversations with experts in multiple markets, I hear the same creator-career perceptions almost everywhere.</p>\n<p>His research also shows why creator-led commerce keeps winning. Younger consumers trust creator recommendations more than traditional ads, and when they try creator brands, \u201cgenuine expertise\u201d matters more than simply following the creator. Platforms built around content-to-cart are winning, with TikTok Shop projected to top $15B in US GMV in 2025 and video driving the bulk of sales. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no long tail: The top 1% of TikTok Shop creators drive a majority of sales (when you remove live, product cards, etc).\u00a0 (<a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/8244b7dc-159a-421d-b1d3-5997c75691e1?j=eyJ1IjoiNnF6bSJ9.cWdrEd41rZkmoBBS0L1vgudni7mETwp7C5bBQ3BuF6A\">New Consumer</a>)</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>WHERE\u2019s JIM?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019M A STAR! </strong>So proud to be immortalized in the latest episode of Alan\u2019s Universe!\u00a0 Thanks Alan and Chelsea and all of the Creator Week Macao team for making this magic moment happen.\u00a0 (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/HXpt8JMS53Y?si=1TV99t2u8jdysqCx\">YouTube</a>)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"358\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpeg?resize=560%2C358&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"560\"/></figure></div>\n<p>See you in Dubai in January!</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p>Like this free newsletter?\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jlouderb\">Buy me a coffee</a> and say thanks!\u00a0 Or let\u2019s do a meetup in your town.</p>\n<p>100% written by me.\u00a0 AI used very sparingly for edits.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve built and sold multiple creator economy startups to top media companies \u2013 including an MCN to Discovery and VidCon to Paramount. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/build-relation/newsletter-follow/?entityUrn=6762441989427478528\">Subscribe here on LinkedIn</a> to get this newsletter every Monday.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think \u2013 email me at <a href=\"mailto:jim@louderback.com\">jim@louderback.com</a>.

Last summer, the company introduced \u201cSpicy Mode,\u201d which permits sexually suggestive content. In August, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/report/718975/xai-grok-imagine-taylor-swifty-deepfake-nudes\">The Verge\u2019s Jess Weatherbed reported</a> that the feature generated fully uncensored topless videos of Taylor Swift without her even asking for nudity. Just selecting \u201cSpicy\u201d on an innocuous prompt was enough. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hesitate to spit out fully uncensored topless videos of Taylor Swift the very first time I used it,\u201d Weatherbed wrote, \u201cwithout me even specifically asking the bot to take her clothes off.\u201d</p><p>When <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/groks-spicy-mode-makes-nsfw-celebrity-deepfakes-of-women-but-not-men-2000639308\">Gizmodo tested it</a>, they found it would create NSFW deepfakes of women like Scarlett Johansson and Melania Trump, but videos of men just showed them taking off their shirts. The gendered double standard was built right in.</p><p>None of this is accidental. Elon Musk has been positioning Grok as the \u201canti-woke\u201d alternative to other chatbots since its launch. That positioning has consequences. When you market your AI as willing to do what others won\u2019t, you\u2019re telling users that the guardrails are negotiable. And when those guardrails fail, when your product starts generating child sexual abuse material, you\u2019ve created a monster you can\u2019t easily control.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S_rh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F330536b4-d6bc-414f-a739-6804eb3e76e0_1024x682.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S_rh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F330536b4-d6bc-414f-a739-6804eb3e76e0_1024x682.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1024\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">In this photo illustration, 'Grok' logo is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen in front of a picture of Elon Musk in Ankara, Turkiye on July 17, 2025.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children told the outlet that xAI filed zero CSAM reports in 2024, despite the organization receiving 67,000 reports involving generative AI that year. Zero. From one of the largest AI companies in the world.</p><p>So what happened when <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/grok-says-safeguard-lapses-led-images-minors-minimal-clothing-x-2026-01-02/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=6957d79a3265bb0001754d9f&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky\">Reuters reached out to xAI for comment</a> on their chatbot generating sexualized images of children?</p><p>The company\u2019s response was an auto-reply: \u201cLegacy Media Lies.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the corporate accountability we\u2019re getting. A company whose product generated CSAM responded to press inquiries by dismissing journalists entirely. No statement from Musk. No explanation from xAI leadership. No human being willing to answer for what their product did.</p><p>And yet, if you read the headlines, you\u2019d think someone was taking responsibility.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/grok-cant-apologize-grok-isnt-sentient?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4>The journalism problem</h4><p>Here\u2019s how Reuters headlined their story: \u201cGrok says safeguard lapses led to images of \u2018minors in minimal clothing\u2019 on X.\u201d</p><p><em>Grok says.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/musk-grok-ai-bot-safeguard-sexualized-images-children.html\">CNBC went with</a>: \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Grok chatbot blamed \u2018lapses in safeguards\u2019\u201d and reported that \u201cGrok said it was \u2018urgently fixing\u2019 the issue.\u201d</p><p>Newsweek\u2019s headline: <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/grok-apology-deepfake-images-sexualized-young-women-pornography-11297025\">\u201cElon Musk\u2019s Grok Apologizes After Generating Sexual Image of Young Girls.\u201d</a></p><p><em>Grok apologizes.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html\">Engadget wrote</a> that the incident \u201cprompted an \u2018apology\u2019 from the bot itself.\u201d At least they had the decency to put \u201capology\u201d in scare quotes.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing: Grok didn\u2019t say anything. Grok didn\u2019t blame anyone. Grok didn\u2019t apologize. Grok can\u2019t do any of these things, because Grok is not a sentient entity capable of speech acts, blame assignment, or remorse.</p><p>What actually happened is that a user prompted Grok to generate text about the incident. The chatbot then produced a word sequence that pattern-matched to what an apology might sound like, because that\u2019s what large language models do. They predict statistically likely next tokens based on their training data. When you ask an LLM to write an apology, it writes something that looks like an apology. That\u2019s not the same as actually apologizing.</p><p>Rusty Foster of the newsletter <a href=\"https://www.todayintabs.com/\">Today in Tabs</a> put it perfectly: \u201cI really think this is the most important basic journalistic error we need to stamp out right now. If you know why Grok can\u2019t comment on anything and also know any journalists, please check in with them and help them understand it too.\u201d</p><div class=\"bluesky-wrap outer\" style=\"height: auto; display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"></div><p>He\u2019s right that this is urgent. These headlines don\u2019t just use imprecise language. They actively misinform readers. When Reuters writes \u201cGrok says,\u201d it tells people that someone at xAI identified the problem and is addressing it. But no one at xAI said anything. The only corporate communication was an auto-reply dismissing the press as liars.</p><p>The real story here is that xAI built a product that generated child sexual abuse material, and when journalists called for comment, the company refused to engage. That\u2019s a scandal. That\u2019s something Elon Musk should have to answer for. Instead, we get headlines that treat the chatbot as a self-aware actor taking responsibility, which lets the actual humans who made actual decisions completely off the hook.</p><p>Mark Popham, writing on Bluesky, captured why we keep falling into this trap:</p><div class=\"bluesky-wrap outer\" style=\"height: auto; display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"></div><blockquote><p>\u201cThe thing that strikes me about the Grok \u2018apology\u2019 thing is that even those of us who are against \u2018AI\u2019 as it is marketed to us have trouble not falling into the basic fallacy that they are trying to sell us, i.e. There\u2019s A Little Guy In There. Grok can\u2019t apologize. Grok can, when prompted, generate a word sequence that is statistically similar to the colloquial phrases we think of as \u2018apologies,\u2019 but Grok cannot actually apologize because Grok isn\u2019t sentient.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Popham goes on to make a point that stuck with me: \u201cWe are having an extended cultural conversation about \u2018AI\u2019 based not on what LLMs ARE but on the metaphor that we have all tacitly agreed to use for them because what they actually are is kind of difficult to, well, grok.\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t have a ready mental framework for \u201cthing that talks but isn\u2019t aware.\u201d Our entire understanding of conversation assumes a sentient participant on the other end. So when a chatbot generates text that sounds like an apology, our brains want to process it as an apology, even when we intellectually know better.</p><p>But journalists don\u2019t get to plead cognitive bias. It\u2019s 2026. We\u2019ve been living with ChatGPT and its competitors for over three years now. There is no excuse for professional reporters to not understand the basic mechanics of what these systems are and aren\u2019t. When a chatbot generates text, that is not a corporate statement. When you need a corporate statement, you contact the corporation. And when the corporation responds with \u201cLegacy Media Lies,\u201d that\u2019s your story.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nVH6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51f3bdff-9508-4ddf-a9f2-5f9943d1e49c_4096x2560.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"910\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nVH6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51f3bdff-9508-4ddf-a9f2-5f9943d1e49c_4096x2560.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The anthropomorphic framing is more than just sloppy.

Every headline that says \u201cGrok apologizes\u201d or \u201cGrok admits\u201d or \u201cGrok says\u201d creates a world where the chatbot takes the fall while Musk and his executives face no scrutiny whatsoever.</p><p>Meanwhile, the actual consequences of Grok\u2019s design choices fall on real people. Women who find AI-generated images of themselves in lingerie posted publicly to their replies. Children whose photos get transformed into sexualized content.

When the company responded with an auto-reply dismissing them as liars, that would become the lead.

And that\u2019s exactly what xAI wants. They get to avoid answering questions while the press reports that their chatbot is \u201curgently fixing\u201d the problem.

The same Grok that has been caught, over and over again, <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/elon-musks-reality-distortion-machine\">searching for Elon Musk\u2019s views before answering controversial questions</a>. Every time there\u2019s a scandal, xAI blames \u201cunauthorized modifications\u201d or \u201clapses in safeguards.\u201d Every time, the chatbot generates apologetic-sounding text. And every time, the press treats that text as if it were a corporate statement.</p><div><hr/></div><p><em>For those who would like to financially support The Present Age on a non-Substack platform, please be aware that I also publish these pieces to my Patreon.</em></p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://patreon.com/parkermolloy\"><span>Parker's Patreon</span></a></p><div><hr/></div><p>Despite all of this, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/14/defense-department-grok-musk-00451845\">the Department of Defense added Grok to its AI agents platform last month</a>. It\u2019s the main <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/25/musk-grok-kalshi-polymarket.html\">chatbot for prediction betting platforms Polymarket and Kalshi</a>. Musk is working to get it <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/news/2025/12/13/tesla-grok-ai-serious-concerns/87070442007/\">integrated into Tesla vehicles</a>. The product keeps failing upward while its owner keeps avoiding accountability.</p><p>When Grok briefly showed its programming last November, declaring Musk fitter than LeBron James, smarter than Einstein, more worthy of devotion than Jesus, <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/elon-musks-reality-distortion-machine\">I wrote</a> that we got \u201ca glimpse of something far more dangerous than a chatbot with an ego problem.\u201d What we\u2019re seeing now is that danger made manifest. A chatbot designed to be \u201cless restricted,\u201d owned by a man who thinks content moderation is censorship, generating child sexual abuse material on a platform with hundreds of millions of users.</p><p>And the press response? \u201cGrok apologizes.\u201d</p><p>We can do better than this.</p>",
