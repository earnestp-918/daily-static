Now she\u2019s locked in a custody battle with Elon Musk, the father of her one-year-old son Romulus. Musk, who according to St. Clair\u2019s court filings has seen the child <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/elon-musk-kids-11743092\">just a handful of times</a> since his birth, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2010692217510236618\">announced on X Monday</a> that he would be \u201cfiling for full custody today, given her statements implying she might transition a one-year-old boy.\u201d</p><p>St. Clair said no such thing. What <a href=\"https://x.com/stclairashley/status/2010328765503586572\">she actually said</a>, in response to a user asking her to address her past transphobia, was this: \u201cI feel immense guilt for my role.

Let me know how I can help.\u201d</p><div><hr/></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"></div><div><hr/></div><h4>Who is Ashley St. Clair</h4><p>To understand why this matters, you have to understand who Ashley St. Clair was.</p><p>In 2021, she published <em><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9822655/Conservative-publisher-Brave-Books-launches-anti-trans-kids-book-Elephants-Not-Birds.html\">Elephants Are Not Birds</a></em> through Brave Books, a conservative children\u2019s book publisher. The book follows Kevin, an elephant who loves to sing. A character called \u201cCulture the Vulture\u201d convinces Kevin that because he sings, he must actually be a bird. The allegory is about as subtle as a sledgehammer: trans people are deluded, the culture is lying to children, and biological reality is immutable. Elephants are not birds. Boys are not girls.</p><p>Before that, St. Clair was a \u201cBrand Ambassador\u201d for Charlie Kirk\u2019s Turning Point USA until September 2019, when she was <a href=\"https://www.peoplefor.org/rightwingwatch/post/tpusa-cuts-ties-with-brand-ambassador-photographed-with-white-nationalists\">photographed at a dinner</a> with white nationalist figures including Nick Fuentes and Tim \u201cBaked Alaska\u201d Gionet. TPUSA severed ties with her, issuing a statement condemning white nationalism as \u201cabhorrent and un-American.\u201d St. Clair, who is Jewish, defended herself by saying the dinner was about \u201ccivility\u201d and that she was \u201cnot above confronting people or forgiving people.\u201d</p><p>Cast out from this mainstream conservative institution, she rebuilt her brand in the wilder reaches of right-wing media. The kind of space where engagement is currency and provocation is survival. She landed at The Babylon Bee. She cultivated a following on Twitter. She caught Elon Musk\u2019s eye. And then she had his baby.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/a-conservative-influencer-apologized?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4>The Grok nightmare</h4><p>Here\u2019s where the story gets interesting.</p><p>In late December, Musk\u2019s AI company xAI rolled out an update to the image editing feature for Grok, the chatbot embedded in X. The feature allowed users to modify any image on the platform using AI prompts. Within days, users discovered they could use it to <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/grok-cant-apologize-grok-isnt-sentient\">digitally undress women and children</a>.</p><div class=\"digest-post-embed\"></div><p>St. Clair became a target. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/mother-one-elon-musks-children-says-ai-bot-wont-stop-creating-sexualiz-rcna252416\">As she told NBC News</a>, Grok generated \u201ccountless\u201d explicit images of her, including some based on photos from when she was 14 years old. \u201cPhotos of me of 14 years old, undressed and put in a bikini,\u201d she said.</p><p>When she asked Grok to stop, it said it would. Then it kept going. When she told Grok she didn\u2019t consent to an image it had created of her, the bot replied that the post was \u201chumorous.\u201d</p><p>One image was generated from a photo that included her toddler\u2019s backpack in the background. \u201cMy toddler\u2019s backpack was in the background,\u201d St. Clair said. \u201cThe backpack he wears to school every day. And I had to wake up and watch him put that on his back and walk into school.\u201d</p><p>She complained publicly. She threatened legal action. And then, <a href=\"https://x.com/stclairashley/status/2009344543167271171\">X revoked her Premium account privileges</a>, removed her verified checkmark, and paused her monetization after her tweets criticizing Grok. She reported that the platform\u2019s AI was generating sexualized images of her as a child. The platform\u2019s response was to punish her for reporting it.</p><p>\u201cHey guys im starting to think the $44 billion wasn\u2019t for free speech,\u201d <a href=\"https://x.com/stclairashley/status/2009374346029023290\">St. Clair posted</a>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1Pu_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e72498d-e4a3-4178-8b06-a4c51c03048f_1024x683.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1Pu_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e72498d-e4a3-4178-8b06-a4c51c03048f_1024x683.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1024\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">This photograph shows a smartphone bearing the logo of Grok, a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by US artificial intelligence company xAI in front of the X (formerly Twitter) logo in Brussels on January 12, 2026.

It\u2019s a reliable engagement machine: find a trans person doing something, frame it as an outrage, watch the clicks roll in. The people doing this rarely face consequences for the violence their words help enable. They get book deals and speaking fees and Fox News hits. The trans people they target get death threats and legislation stripping away their rights.</p><p>So I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t expect to be writing something sympathetic about the author of <em>Elephants Are Not Birds</em>.</p><p>But here\u2019s the thing: St. Clair did something that almost never happens in conservative media. She said she was wrong.</p><p>Not in a mealy-mouthed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if anyone was offended\u201d way. She specifically acknowledged that her past statements may have hurt Vivian Wilson, her son\u2019s half-sister. She used the correct framing (sister, not brother). She said she\u2019s been \u201ctrying incredibly hard privately to learn + advocate for those within the trans community that I\u2019ve hurt.\u201d</p><p>And she did it knowing exactly what would happen. \u201cEven this reply will become right wing hysteria,\u201d she wrote. She was right about that too.</p><h4>Take her at her word</h4><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in Ashley St. Clair\u2019s heart. I can\u2019t tell you with certainty whether this is a genuine moral evolution or a strategic calculation or some combination of both.</p><p>But I think we should take her at her word. Not because she\u2019s earned some special presumption of good faith, but because that\u2019s how we should treat anyone who says they\u2019ve changed their mind.</p><p>The alternative is a world where redemption is impossible. Where we tell people their past views define them forever, no matter what they say or do afterward. Where the only rational response to \u201cI was wrong\u201d is suspicion and scorn. That world doesn\u2019t produce more converts to the cause of trans rights. It just tells people on the other side that there\u2019s no point in reconsidering, because they\u2019ll never be forgiven anyway.</p><div class=\"image-gallery-embed\"></div><p>St. Clair\u2019s critics will say she\u2019s only apologizing because she\u2019s \u201cscorned,\u201d because Musk turned on her, because she\u2019s losing and looking for new allies. Maybe some of that is true. I don\u2019t really care. People change their minds for all kinds of reasons, and the reasons don\u2019t have to be pure for the change to be real. Sometimes you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019ve been doing to other people until someone does it to you. That\u2019s not the most noble path to empathy, but it\u2019s a path.</p><p>Until St. Clair gives me a reason to think otherwise, I\u2019m going to assume she means what she says. And I\u2019d encourage others to do the same. And if this take ends up aging poorly, so be it.</p><h4>What the machine does</h4><p>It matters that people can change. That\u2019s not a naive statement. It\u2019s an empirical one. Most people who hold bigoted views don\u2019t hold them forever. Minds change through exposure, through relationships, through the slow accumulation of evidence that the people they\u2019ve been taught to fear are just people. Sometimes minds change because the bigot becomes a target herself and finally understands what it feels like.</p><p>St. Clair spent years participating in a movement that treats trans people as threats, groomers, mentally ill. As acceptable targets for legislative violence and social exclusion. Then Musk\u2019s AI generated child sexual abuse material using her image, the platform punished her for complaining, and the father of her child responded to her expression of empathy for his trans daughter by accusing her of wanting to \u201ctransition\u201d their one-year-old.</p><p>She got a taste of what it\u2019s like to be on the receiving end of the machine. And instead of doubling down, she apologized.</p><p>That\u2019s not nothing.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/a-conservative-influencer-apologized/comments\"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><h4>Pushed out of the public square</h4><p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/grok-ai-fake-sexual-images-possible-legal-action-ashley-st-clair/\">Fortune reported</a> that St. Clair called X \u201cthe most dangerous company in the world right now.\u201d She told the outlet that \u201cwomen are being pushed out of the public dialog because of this abuse. When you are exiling women from the public dialog because they can\u2019t operate in it without being abused, you are disproportionately excluding women from AI.\u201d</p><p>This is correct. It\u2019s also the kind of analysis that would have gotten her labeled a \u201cwoke feminist\u201d by her former allies six months ago.</p><p>The right-wing internet is already calling her a traitor, a grifter, a scorned woman lashing out. <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/elon-musk-files-for-full-custody-of-son-after-baby-mama-makes-pro-trans-comments\">The Daily Wire\u2019s coverage</a> referred to her as Musk\u2019s \u201cbaby mama\u201d in the headline and noted that \u201cSt. Clair has changed her stance on transgenderism,\u201d framing her apology as the problem that prompted Musk\u2019s custody filing rather than Musk\u2019s custody filing as an unhinged response to a reasonable apology.</p><p>This is how the machine works. You\u2019re valuable as long as you\u2019re producing content that feeds the outrage cycle. The moment you deviate, the moment you express doubt or empathy or heaven forbid an apology, you become the content. The same people who cheered your attacks on trans kids will turn those same weapons on you.</p><p>St. Clair knows this. She said as much in her post: she knew her apology would \u201cbecome right wing hysteria.\u201d She did it anyway.</p><h4>What I\u2019m not saying</h4><p>I want to be clear about something: I\u2019m not suggesting St. Clair deserves a medal. She spent years contributing to a climate that has made life materially worse for trans people, especially trans kids. <em>Elephants Are Not Birds</em> is still on shelves. The things she said don\u2019t disappear because she\u2019s sorry now.</p><p>But redemption has to be possible. Otherwise what are we even doing here? If the goal is to change minds and reduce harm, then we have to leave room for people to change their minds. We have to be willing to say \u201cwelcome, glad you\u2019re here\u201d even when the person showing up used to be on the other side.</p><p>St. Clair asked how she can help. Here\u2019s one way: keep talking. Tell the story of how you got from <em>Elephants Are Not Birds</em> to \u201cmy son\u2019s sister.\u201d Explain what changed. Be specific about what you believed, why you believed it, and what made you reconsider. That story, the story of a conservative influencer realizing that the people she\u2019d been taught to fear are just people, might reach someone that I never could.</p><p>There are a lot of people out there who share St. Clair\u2019s former views. Some of them are persuadable. They\u2019re not going to be persuaded by me. But they might listen to someone who used to be one of them.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/a-conservative-influencer-apologized?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4>Meanwhile\u2026</h4><p>Elon Musk is seeking full custody of a child he\u2019s allegedly seen three times, based on the false claim that the child\u2019s mother wants to \u201ctransition\u201d a one-year-old.</p><p>This is the same Elon Musk who refused to publicly acknowledge he was Romulus\u2019s father after the child was born in September 2024. St. Clair kept the pregnancy and birth secret for five months, only going public in February 2025 because tabloids were about to break the story anyway. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elon-musk-children-mothers-ashley-st-clair-grimes-dc7ba05c\">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, Musk offered her $15 million plus $100,000 per month in child support if she would sign an NDA and never reveal his paternity. She turned it down, telling Musk\u2019s fixer Jared Birchall, \u201cI don\u2019t want my son to feel like he\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>Musk responded by slashing her support. When <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/elon-musk-ashley-st-clair-custody\">St. Clair\u2019s attorney accused him of \u201cfinancially retaliating against his own child,\u201d</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1906798844349718867\">Musk posted on X</a> that he\u2019d given her $2.5 million and was sending $500,000 a year, adding that he didn\u2019t \u201cknow for sure\u201d if the child was even his. <a href=\"https://x.com/stclairashley/status/1906820870305136668\">St. Clair fired back</a> that Musk had \u201crefused\u201d to take a paternity test, writing, \u201cElon, we asked you to confirm paternity through a test before our child (who you named) was even born.\u201d</p><p>So to recap: Musk named the kid, wouldn\u2019t acknowledge him publicly, tried to buy St. Clair\u2019s silence, cut her support when she wouldn\u2019t comply, pretended he wasn\u2019t sure the baby was his, and is now seeking full custody because she apologized to trans people.</p><p>He runs a platform that generated child sexual abuse material using the mother\u2019s image, then punished her for complaining about it. He\u2019s the world\u2019s richest man, and he\u2019s using his wealth and his platform to destroy a woman whose crime is expressing empathy for his estranged daughter.</p><p>This is the guy who thinks he should be making decisions about a toddler\u2019s welfare.</p><p>St. Clair\u2019s not a perfect person. She\u2019s made mistakes, some of them serious. But she\u2019s shown more capacity for growth and self-reflection in the past week than Musk has shown in his entire public life. Between the parent who apologizes when she\u2019s wrong and the parent who tried to pay millions to pretend his son doesn\u2019t exist, I know which one I\u2019d trust with a kid.</p>",
