Google\u2019s NotebookLM helped kick this off, but now top creators, startups, and established media companies are leaning in.</p>\n<p>Inception Point AI, for example, says it has produced 200,000 episodes, claiming that at times its shows accounted for 1% of all podcasts released in a given week. Steven Bartlett is using AI to create more content for his podcast fans. And The Washington Post is creating \u201cYour Personal Podcast\u201d to build podcasts tailored to each user\u2019s profile.</p>\n<p>These experiments are roundly criticized by traditional media, but they aren\u2019t going away. More from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/13/nx-s1-5641047/washington-posts-ai-podcast\">NPR</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-12/ai-podcasting-is-changing-industry\">LA Times</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"223\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.png?resize=206%2C223&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"206\"/></figure></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Rise of Biometric Algorithms</h3>\n<p>Social algorithms will start incorporating data from health trackers to deliver even more targeted recommendations, and more insidious ways to addict us to the feed.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll move beyond time-spent and click-throughs to heart-rate spikes and pupillary dilation. Some platforms may even push bio-integration to deliver interruption-free content (and yes, this could be how Western microdramas monetize).</p>\n<p>The consequences are wide-ranging:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Creators optimize for physical response, not just retention.</li>\n<li>\u201cPhysiological editing\u201d becomes a thing.</li>\n<li>Iron-clad vendor lock-in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, your body will betray you.

What to eat. When to sleep. Who to date.</p>\n<p>Fans will even control a creator\u2019s environment: thermostat, lighting, alarm clock, smartwatch. Creators who embrace this will outsource decision-making to their audience. Fans will relish controlling something, anything, in our topsy-turvy world.</p>\n<p>This voluntary dehumanization gives us Truman Show 2.0, where Truman is begging for donations and the audience is the director.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"205\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-4.png?resize=204%2C205&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"204\"/></figure></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Verification Vlogging</strong></h3>\n<p>Flesh and blood creators will increasingly opt for ways to prove they are human, not AI constructs<strong>. </strong>From the \u201cPlayable Creator\u201d to live streamed and IRL appearances, human markers explode.</p>\n<p>One creepy format that\u2019s already emerging is boredom content: creators sleeping, eating messy food, stumbling over words, and even sprinkling grammatical and spelling errors into their newsletters (some creators are already doing this\u2026 wink-wink).</p>\n<p>The world increasingly bifurcates:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Scalable, synthetic and corporate owned perfection.</li>\n<li>Messy, gross and error-prone humans.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-5.png?resize=192%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"192\"/></figure></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Life as a service</h3>\n<p>In 2026 and beyond, creators will realize their body and their voice are an asset class.</p>\n<p>Mid-tier creators will start licensing their deepfake rights so they can \u201cwork\u201d in multiple places at once. Brands will use recognizable creator likenesses as customer support reps, virtual store clerks, and region-specific ad characters.</p>\n<p>Voice becomes its own asset class too, as more companies follow ElevenLabs by licensing a creator\u2019s voice for separate AI avatars. When identity decouples from the physical person, creators become IP holding companies.</p>\n<p>The good news: it becomes easier to sell a channel.</p>\n<p>The downside: it multiplies key-person risk. What happens when your avatar goes off the rails and starts spewing racist or illegal nonsense?</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Related</strong>: Creators will sell customized AI versions of themselves to superfans, and platforms will try to muscle in on the revenue.</li>\n<li><strong>Related</strong>: Taken to its macabre extreme, we\u2019ll see creators \u201clive\u201d long beyond their lifespan.

That\u2019s exactly my audience: marketers, media execs, founders, top creators and operators who shape budgets and make decisions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A weekly sponsorship puts your company inside a trusted, high-intent environment, shows up repeatedly where it actually matters, and aligns your brand with the point-of-view content buyers say moves them. If you want to speak to the people building the next wave of media, creators, and AI, this is where they show up every week.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Drop me an <a href=\"mailto:jim@louderback.com\">email</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ScSYOFx3aV0eKfKqqqA-JxV-ibrNbhufuNE2NbYFJk/edit?tab=t.0\">check out our sponsorship information here.</a></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1BFS  RECAP</h2>\n<p>The 1 Billion Followers Summit was a magical and amazing gathering of creators, execs, investors and platforms from around the world.\u00a0 My Economy track featured 120 speakers and 55 sessions across four stages, focusing on what\u2019s happening now, and what the future holds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some key takeaways:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CREATORS AND REPRESENTATION</strong></h3>\n<p>CAA top exec @Brent Weinstein and I sat down for a fireside chat exploring the new CAA Creators, where the industry is going and more.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what I learned:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Podcasting as Training Wheels:</strong> Traditional celebs have tried to enter the creator space with decidedly uneven results.\u00a0 Podcasting gives them a back door that makes the shift so much easier.\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Who\u2019s Afraid of the Big Bad Slop:</strong> Not Brent\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Sports Rises:</strong> Creators are embracing sports, and athletes are emerging as a powerful creator class. Huge growth area.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>LINKEDIN CHANGES AHEAD</strong></h3>\n<p>I talked with LinkedIn\u2019s head of creator product @Sam Carrao Clanon to get a peek into the future of the B2B platform.\u00a0 Key insights:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Analytics:</strong>\u00a0 LinkedIn knows creators need better data, and they can\u2019t do everything. Expect better analytics this year. He also hinted an open API might be on the horizon.</li>\n<li><strong>To Video or Not to Video:\u00a0 </strong>Exaggerating for effect, Clanon said you should either do all video or none. My take: make video your primary focus, or keep it as an occasional dabble.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimal Post Frequency</strong>:\u00a0 3-5 times a week</li>\n<li><strong>He\u2019s Killing the \u201cFormula\u201d </strong>:\u00a0 The tired post format of hook, personal story, bulleted list and call to action will be de-prioritized.\u00a0 Clanon wants all types of posts, from one-liners to deep insight, to thrive on LinkedIn.</li>\n<li><strong>Pods</strong>: LinkedIn sounds serious about de-emphasizing pods, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>INSDE THE BELLY OF THE BEAST</strong></h3>\n<p>I also had a chance to chat with Mr Beast\u2019s head of channel @Will Fowler, and his commercial counterpart @Beau Avril about how commerce and creative collaborate on Beast videos.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Treat Integrations as Content:</strong> Brand deals are part of the story arc, not a sponsorship interrupt. Brands get pulled in early, but integrations must elevate the episode and protect retention. Best examples (Starbucks in \u201c30 Days in the Sky,\u201d DoorDash in \u201c100 Days on a Jet\u201d) work because the brand solves a real problem aligned with the premise. Also, it helps that Jimmy genuinely gets excited about brand partners.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideas Come from Anywhere</strong>: Often via a 3 a.m. call from Jimmy. They quickly vet concepts via title and thumbnail development, then move into a hard feasibility phase that weighs timeline, build complexity, and even whether the science exists to support the premise (90 Days in Space, for example, requires SpaceX to step up).</p>\n<p><strong>Time Rules:</strong> Shoots can run 30\u2013100 days, with teams filming nearly nonstop. Roughly four episodes are in production at any time, scaling to seven soon, which likely means external help.</p>\n<p><strong>Strong Advice</strong>: Creators should explain their audience\u2019s unique value to brands. Brands should stop over-engineering and trust creators to keep them native to the story.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SUPERFANS BEAT FOLLOWERS\u00a0</h3>\n<p>I loved the discussion with @Abby Ho, @Sara Wilson, and @Jo Burford about the move from scale to trust.</p>\n<p>They argued we\u2019ve shifted from the social graph to an AI-driven interest graph, where having a million followers doesn\u2019t mean a million people see you. I\u2019d take it one step further: AI is pushing us from the interest graph to the trust graph, meaning who we trust and where and how to we connect.</p>\n<p>Followers are losing power as a metric. Distribution is becoming identity-based relevance. Sharing happens more in DMs and private groups than public feeds. But these niche groups aren\u2019t necessarily small.\u00a0 Instead, they are focused and specific.</p>\n<p>Best advice? Design your content and brand messaging for the \u201cOMG that\u2019s so me\u201d moment and you\u2019ll have a fan for life.\u00a0 \u00a0Stop marketing to communities and start building with them. The real risk isn\u2019t being too niche. It\u2019s being culturally irrelevant at scale.</p>\n<p>They also nailed the fandom trap: Show up late with slow activations, then show up wrong by not speaking the language. And beware overfeeding fandoms until they fatten up into manufactured affinity.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1BFS QUIBIS</h2>\n<p><strong>The \u201cCurse of Knowledge\u201d:</strong> Many creators fail to monetize because they assume everyone knows what they know. @Justin Mecham, founder of Creatyl, said what feels \u201cbasic\u201d to a creator often feels like \u201cmagic\u201d or \u201cwizardry\u201d to the audience.</p>\n<p><strong>LinkedIn\u2019s Content Deficit</strong>: @Vin Matano, CEO of CreatorBuzz shared that despite having over 1 billion users, only 1% of LinkedIn users create content, making it a massive \u201ccontent-deficient\u201d opportunity for influence and credibility.</p>\n<p><strong>The \u201c11th Episode\u201d Benchmark:</strong> In podcasting, explained Gautam Raj Anand, founder and CEO of Hubhopper, reaching the 11th episode puts a creator in the top 1% of podcasters globally due to the high rate of \u201cpodfading\u201d (quitting early).</p>\n<p><strong>On Audio</strong>: \u201cFood without taste is the equivalent of content without audio\u2026 video without audio and music is like empty calories.\u201d \u2014 @<em>Oscar H\u00f6glund, CEO of Epidemic Sound</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>On Branding:</strong> \u201cTrends are containers. They\u2019re not really the idea\u2026 The more you jump on trends, the less distinctive you will look.\u201d \u2014 @<em>Sara Zouad, CEO of Brand Builders</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>On Monetization</strong>: \u201cAs a creator, if you\u2019re solving people\u2019s problems, it\u2019s okay to make money\u2026 If you\u2019re not making crazy money as a creator, it\u2019s a hobby.\u201d \u2014 @<em>Justin Mecham, Founder of Creatyl</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>On Business Ownership:</strong> \u201cControl equals freedom.

      "bodyText": "<h1>0.0 Context Setting</h1>\n<p>I am sneakily writing this on Wednesday, January 14, 2026 in Portland Oregon, where I just finished writing the previous episode. </p>\n<p>It is taking <em>a lot</em> of energy to deal with my impulse control to post this straight away, and what I\u2019m going to do instead is schedule it for Thursday, just to annoy Pavel and beat his issue of The Product Picnic<sup id=\"fnref:picnic\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:picnic\">1</a></sup>. </p>\n<h1>1.1 The Problem is Defining the Problem</h1>\n<p>I\u2019m not, personally, worried too much about AI completely devastating my work. I may be completely misplaced in this assumption, though.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a big fight going on about the usage of AI in developing software. There\u2019s a big continuum here! </p>\n<p>On one end you have my friends Jesse Vincent and Simon Willison, who are more or less forging ahead at using agentic coding (i.e. LLMs for writing software, commonly Claude Code) to become even more irritatingly productive than they already are, a sort of Captain America-serum supercharged already-10x developer.</p>\n<p>The thing is, you have to be so precise about what someone is using generative AI for these days because as a recent saying goes, AI progress and capability is <em>jagged</em>, which is another way of saying \u201call over the heckin\u2019 place\u201d. They can do some things really well, and are stunningly bad at other things (those other things include stuff like \u201chow many rs are there in the word irresponsible\u201d).</p>\n<p>If you recognize that you\u2019ve got a tool with wildly different capability in different domains, then you also recognize that you have a capricious tool and you need to know what you\u2019re doing to not shoot yourself in your foot or deglove yourself or whatever. (Don\u2019t look up degloving if you don\u2019t know what it is, trust me.)</p>\n<p>Simon and Jesse are experts with decades of software development knowledge. I also understand them to be systems thinkers - they know enough about how everything works. In temperament as well, they\u2019re curious but also untrusting. Not everyone is like them. The point here is that the tools aren\u2019t easy to use well, where \u201cwell\u201d means producing software that meets certain criteria. What Simon and Jesse are also good at is deciding what those criteria are in ways that are appropriate to the task and context. This is also something that not everyone is good at. </p>\n<p>I think \u201cdeciding what well is\u201d is an inherently human skill that is very difficult for AI to replicate well enough consistently.</p>\n<p>Iris Meredith wrote this piece that Kevin Wriggle quoted<sup id=\"fnref:quoted\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:quoted\">2</a></sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More generally, what I got from this is that LLM-assisted coding is only more flexible and more chill than doing the thing manually if you don't care about results at all. The moment you start caring about a specific output rather than something vaguely output-shaped, it all of a sudden becomes a whole lot more rigid and finicky than just writing the thing manually. And that's quite the opposite of what LLM assistants promise.<sup id=\"fnref2:iris\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:iris\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In case it\u2019s not clear, the jaggedness and unevenness of the tools means that I disagree with Meredith, to a degree. I\u2019ll rewrite with emphasis in a way that I hope doesn\u2019t invalidate Meredith\u2019s point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More generally, what I got from this is that LLM-assisted coding is only more flexible and more chill than doing the thing manually if you don't care about results at all. The moment you start caring about a specific output rather than something vaguely output-shaped, it all of a sudden becomes a whole lot more rigid and finicky than <strong>you</strong> just writing the thing manually. And that's quite the opposite of what LLM assistants promise.<sup id=\"fnref:iris\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:iris\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the point here is that agentic coding/LLM-assisted coding (and therefore I think all LLM tools <em>in general</em>) is that <strong>they are not general purpose tools</strong>. Or, rather, the domains in which they are general purpose tools that are <em>good enough</em> for people are also uneven, but that\u2019s not exposed when you\u2019re \u201cusing ChatGPT\u201d. This problem is also obscured (intentionally?) by the chat-based interface, which provides no real indication or feedback about the specific things the LLM is good at -- there are no task-specific UIs for general agents. </p>\n<p>I think what Simon and Jesse have done is to massively customize the tools for their own particular usage. That\u2019s on a different end of the continuum of using LLM-assisted coding out of the box. <em>They just aren\u2019t ready for mass use yet</em>.</p>\n<p>This is not a criticism, in any way, of Meredith\u2019s capability or experience. And at the same time maybe the insight isn\u2019t particularly deep and it\u2019s just that I came about it another way: if you don\u2019t know how to use a tool, then you won\u2019t use it well and you won\u2019t know when you\u2019re using it dangerously. I\u2019m quite happy to place irresponsibility here on the lawn of the product marketers, who <em>are</em> presenting these as general purpose products. I\u2019ve written before about how egregiously irresponsible OpenAI is in hiding what you shouldn\u2019t use ChatGPT for in fine print, (in a filing cabinet, disused toilet, basement, beware of leopard etc) in its terms and conditions of usage. Bullshit, I say.</p>\n<p>So I think I disagree as to the utility of LLM-assisted coding agents in that finicky lawyerly way of \u201cokay, but here are the instances in which they\u2019re clearly useful and some people are clearly deriving benefit\u201d. </p>\n<p>I will lay aside (yes, I know), the immoral manner in which the data for these agents has been gathered/stolen/appropriated under a political and regulatory environment that outright encourages such stealing and also now that it\u2019s happened wishes to preserve those interests \u201cOh no, we\u2019ll go bankrupt if we have to compensate artists\u201d and \u201cwell we couldn\u2019t possibly let that happen\u201d. I will acknowledge that yes, we have legislated to stop doing things before, in the face of incredibly powerful lobbying, when indoor smoking was banned and that yes of course we can just do things.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I digress, but also do not intend to dismiss a stupendously big societal elephant in the room.</p>\n<p>Meredith wrote about <em>caring about a specific output, rather than something vaguely output-shaped</em> which is not an LLM-problem (which Meredith makes clear) but a human problem. Humans -- people -- are the ones who ultimately set goals. <em>There is nothing else in our entire experience right now that can do this</em>. I mean we could decide that dolphins are sentient and collaborate with them to set goals, but like I said \u201c<em>in our entire experience right now\u201d</em>. In that same conversation with Riggle, Riggle said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As I keep saying, human understanding will always matter</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and to which I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To the extent that we exist and tools don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, yeah! There is no no-human-in-the-loop, it\u2019s like some sort of anthropic principle for technology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The argument, again, here is that technology inherently has a bias because humans have a bias and like the theory of the anthropic principle (the universe only exists because we are here to exist, may as well call it the eogist principle), <em>technology and tools don\u2019t exist without people</em>.</p>\n<p>The first mover is always a human: a human aways, always, <strong>always</strong> started it.</p>\n<p>What I mean here is that we define goals, which in this case means what the software is supposed to do, which means we define outcomes. We define and set the parameters of the outcomes. Like I\u2019ve written before, those parameters define what\u2019s good enough, what trade-offs exist because everything is a trade-off. Everything is a negotiation of what you will accept, and in software development that\u2019s normally boiled down to fast/cheap/correct, and you can only realistically pick one. </p>\n<p>The problem is that figuring out what we want is one of the hardest things in the world, and I don\u2019t just mean in the personal \u201cwhat is the point of my life\u201d sense. There is always more detail. There are always more edge cases because the universe goes on. On one level you can say because of entropy, on another level you can say it\u2019s because you don\u2019t control everything, on one more level you can say it\u2019s because humans are batshit crazy and will come up with a whole bunch of ways to do things that you never conceived of which, to be fair, is one of the strengths that got us here in the first place.</p>\n<p>Now, <em>one</em> way that we invented to deal with the \u201cwe don\u2019t know what we want\u201d problem in software development is this whole agile development process. Which as a refresher is roughly along these lines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we don\u2019t know what we want</li>\n<li>but if we\u2019re given something, we can provide feedback on it (I don\u2019t want <em>that, why did you do that?!</em>)</li>\n<li>we can take that feedback and then change the thing</li>\n<li>repeat until the heat death of the universe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What this ultimately emphasizes is that a practice of iteration/repetition allows the possibility of improvement. </p>\n<p>I was very careful there to say <em>the possibility</em> of improvement, because humans in general are lazy which is totally fine and not a value judgment, and when we\u2019re lazy we tend to skip steps and think that iteration/repetition <em>automatically leads to improvement</em>. Which it doesn\u2019t, not if you put it that way.</p>\n<p>When I work with people and we really slow down then I\u2019ll ask: well, what improvement are we looking for?</p>\n<p>And invariably people get a bit stumped there. One common reaction (but a minority, to be clear) is a bit of anger and lashing out because they think they should know the answer and isn\u2019t there an obvious answer. The reason why they\u2019re angry is that there isn\u2019t a good (sorry, a <strong>useful</strong>) answer.</p>\n<p>My pithy version of this insight [sic] that I use in my work is to rephrase as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Agile is a great way to do the wrong thing faster</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which a) sticks in peoples\u2019 minds because it\u2019s pithy and I guess mean? and b) is an opening for a bunch of people to admit that nobody (or leadership) knows what it is they\u2019re supposed to be doing here in the first place in useful detail.</p>\n<p>Agentic coding -- using LLMs to write code -- is certainly a way to write more code more quickly. The argument I\u2019m piecing together supported by Meredith is that writing more code more quickly is useless (or even worse, actively harmful) towards achieving your desired outcome.</p>\n<p>You achieve what you want by being able to define what you want. Defining what you want is <em>hard</em>. In the language of AI researchers, defining your problem is something that nothing, nobody, not ever can ever one-shot (i.e. get right first time) because part of defining what you want involves almost limitless context to determine what\u2019s good enough and hoping that matches up with what <em>you</em> think is good enough, dealing with the difference between the two, and then a human <em>making a decision</em>.</p>\n<p>Many people don\u2019t, in general, like making decisions because they might be wrong and then they are shouted at by mean people. This is a genuine problem holding us back as a society, I am being absolutely sincere.</p>\n<p>I concede that LLMs might be able to produce a range of good-enoughs. I see this with Claude Code when it\u2019s in planning mode and I explicitly ask it to provide me options with different trade-offs and then explore those trade-offs so I can think about them. I don\u2019t want <em>the one thing to do</em>. Or rather, there are cases where I know enough that I don\u2019t want the one thing to do. There\u2019s an argument here that at one level the implementation of software doesn\u2019t fundamentally matter and your choices are more a matter of taste, and that in different areas the architecture and implementation do have a much more significant impact. Knowing that comes with experience, or at least something that has access to experience. We used to also call these things expert systems, but it turns out the lazier way to do that was to just throw the entire internet at them and assume that means expertise just sort of spontaneously emerges. (Seriously).</p>\n<p>So. What might AI coding be good for?</p>\n<p>Well, in small cases where you <em>don\u2019t</em> care as much about correctness and for low-stakes sure, it\u2019s fine. </p>\n<p>If you want to use it for prototyping something that you don\u2019t use in production, sure, because then you can prototype something more quickly and might realize earlier that you missed a critical thing. This is good! You have more things to provide feedback on to interrogate the tradeoffs and decisions you have to make.</p>\n<p>One way of thinking about this -- and I am thinking out loud -- is that agentic coding is a bit like a really inefficient way of modularizing software development. One way to think about this is Python or Node where there are modules or packages for anything and you can reuse code someone else has written. When done this way you have some assurance (ha, supply-chain attacks) that the code you\u2019re using works, there are tests and so on. Agentic coding has the sort of ability to provide modularization of functionality, but also in a non-deterministic sense. Instead of importing a package you can totally be lazy and tell an agent to implement it for you. That is probably not a good idea because you\u2019re losing the ability to reuse something, you\u2019re just <em>regenerating</em> something. But if it <em>looks</em> like it does the job and it does the job well-enough and it was easier to tell an agent to regenerate that functionality then I\u2019m afraid humans are going to do that. It is stupid and it is inefficient but the impulse is understandable, at least. </p>\n<p>More experienced people will use tactics like tell an agent to use an existing package or have an idea of what package they already want to use, or even implement a package that can be reused in a particular project, plus have the ability and presence of mind to check whether that package has actually been reused. And again, that\u2019s <em>if they\u2019ve decided it matters</em>. </p>\n<p>I suppose one equivalent aspect is if you can trust an agent about information retrieval. It is easier (but with no guarantees about accuracy or correctness) to ask a coding agent for best practices in the same context in which you\u2019re working than to go look up what OWASP standards, read them, and then translate them back to the work you\u2019re doing. But that\u2019s if you can be sure that the agent is returning the actual OWASP standards. Are you going to check? Well if you\u2019re going to check, why not just go read them yourself in the first place? </p>\n<p>But a lot of functions are common. A lot shouldn\u2019t be reimplemented. And that \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d is a mixture I think of taste and a mixture of experience and capability. Some people can keep and develop good best practices in their head and know when they\u2019re appropriate and when they\u2019re not according to the circumstance and context. For those common features, I don\u2019t know, things like reference architectures that can get you started, things like Django that Willison co-created, you just use them because they fit the problem you\u2019re trying to solve. </p>\n<p>In what circumstances is it good enough to use a coding agent to step into the place of using existing packages or frameworks? An example question I might ask is: Hey, I want to make a tool that my family wants to use. How should I go about it? And I think a problem right now is that unless you\u2019re someone who has the knowledge to say \u201cdon\u2019t fucking overengineer it and build me a fucking react app, it just needs to be some html and javascript\u201d (which is what Willison does!), then you\u2019re likely (I think!) to get something that is kind of right but also not. </p>\n<p>Sure, maybe what you get is good-enough. But I suppose the point that I\u2019ve been trying to make for the last 2,600-odd words is how you decide what good-enough is. Humans decide that using \u201cexperience\u201d which is the sum total of, I don\u2019t know, everything you\u2019ve ever experienced? And then some sort of decision-making process that figures out what to prioritize and what to de-prioritize. My standing point right now is that no model has anywhere near the capability to match a human in terms of that experience. A lot of discussion here is about <em>world models</em> and <em>embodiment</em> which is to say that if you want a machine to make suggestions (or worse, decisions) about things that affect humans, then it would be good for those machines to have the best understanding of the world in which humans live. The pitch from AI companies right now is that \u201cgood enough\u201d for that world model is \u201cwhatever you can access on the internet by hook or crook\u201d, and I think that\u2019s a combination of a business decision (driven by, you know, wanting to make money) and a particular mental outlook and philosophy of a particular temperament which we may as well loosely label as \u201coverly STEM-focussed and reductive\u201d that <em>of course</em> the internet represents the sum of human experience and is good enough. <strong>Clearly</strong> there are people who disagree. I am one of them. And yes, I will acknowledge that some of the things on the internet are video of things that happen in the real world, but all of that video on the internet is the result of a human editorial decision about what\u2019s important enough to upload <em>even if it\u2019s mundane</em>. </p>\n<p>Look, let\u2019s segue. It\u2019s not as if this isn\u2019t all over the place anyway.</p>\n<h2>1.2 The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Actually Caring and Giving a Damn</h2>\n<p>I am fighting a losing battle against good-enough. I wrote about it not too long ago<sup id=\"fnref:good\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:good\">4</a></sup>. Dan Sinker wrote eloquently (i.e. in a Dan Sinker-y way) about it in The Who Cares Era<sup id=\"fnref:whocares\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:whocares\">5</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>I was talking today with an organization design professional and the perils of being a systems thinker. She was talking about seeing baggage claim at an airport and realizing that it could be organized in a different way so people wouldn\u2019t have to wait so long. I talked about how I have a hobby of taking pictures of signs people have to put on things, like on the inside of the door at a hospital toilet where a makeshift sign very clearly tells you how to lock the door, because how you\u2019d assume locks it totally does not. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a story about the door. The door gets bought because the building needs a door and the requirements for the door in this case are, say, \u201cis a powered door suitable for an accessible single-user bathroom\u201d and then presumably the physical requirements. Maybe an architect puts these requirements together or the general contractor and then the client signs off on them and then ta-da you\u2019ve got a renovated ER wing. </p>\n<p>But the door is a shit door because hey guess what -- now, this is a bit facetious -- nobody thought about how a door is supposed to work and made a bunch of assumptions. I get we\u2019re all busy. I get we\u2019re all burned out. But I genuinely believe that if someone actually gave a damn and had thought things through then the nurses (invariably this stuff is done by the people who have the most contact with the public using a service or the users or whomever) wouldn\u2019t have to make a fucking sign and keep making sure that the sign is visible. Just get a fucking door that works properly.</p>\n<p>It is horrible that it feels like a luxury to be able to care in your work. No, wait. People do care. It is horrible that it feels like a luxury to <em>actually</em> care in your work. </p>\n<p>I mean, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re working at the world\u2019s largest retailer that also happens to be obsessively focussed on the customer. Because that retailer <em>definitely</em> shows signs of caring.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>YES. I beat the last newsletter episode and we\u2019re at ~3,300 words for this one.</p>\n<p>I am that particular combination of angry and motivated, which I\u2019m reminded is the point of anger in the first place: something is not the way you want it to be and now you have some energy to deal with it.

CBS\u2019s own medical producer raised some of them before publication, asking in an email whether the network could clarify \u201cwhat type of treatment he received\u201d and whether Ross underwent surgery. These questions went unanswered.</p><p>Reiter, the senior vice president, spelled out the problem in his email: \u201cA bruise is internal bleeding. But it can also be something serious. We do know that the ICE agent walked away from the incident \u2014 we have that on camera.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. We do have that on camera. Multiple videos from the scene show Ross walking around in the aftermath of the shooting. He moved without apparent difficulty. He drove away from the scene. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5688741-ice-officer-who-shot-renee-good-in-minneapolis-suffered-internal-bleeding-dhs-says/\">said on January 7</a> that Ross \u201cwent to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released.\u201d Same-day discharge.</p><p>None of this means Ross wasn\u2019t injured. But it does mean that \u201cinternal bleeding\u201d without context is close to meaningless. The term covers everything from a bruise you\u2019d get bumping into a table to a life-threatening hemorrhage. When your own senior vice president is pointing out that the claim you\u2019re about to publish could mean almost anything, and your medical producer is asking for basic details you can\u2019t provide, and your sourcing is two anonymous government officials with an obvious interest in justifying a shooting that has sparked national protests, you might want to wait until you have more information.</p><p>Unless waiting isn\u2019t the point.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/what-the-trump-administration-is?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4>The amplification pipeline</h4><p>The CBS story published on the afternoon of January 14.

It doesn\u2019t say she \u201calmost killed\u201d Ross. It says Ross had \u201cinternal bleeding,\u201d a term so vague that CBS\u2019s own senior vice president had to point out it could describe a bruise. But once the story was out, it became raw material. Vance and Musk took the CBS reporting and turned it into confirmation of claims the administration had been making since the day of the shooting.</p><p>Conservative media followed. RedState ran a piece headlined <a href=\"https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2026/01/14/exploding-the-narrative-report-says-agent-who-shot-renee-good-suffered-internal-bleeding-n2198128\">\u201cExploding the Leftist Narrative? DHS Confirms Agent Who Shot Renee Good Suffered \u2018Internal Bleeding.\u2019\u201d</a> The article celebrated the CBS report as vindication, crowing that it would \u201cdestroy\u201d criticism of the shooting. Twitchy, another conservative site, <a href=\"https://twitchy.com/justmindy/2026/01/14/officer-internal-bleeding-renee-good-minnesota-n2423917\">mocked</a> Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who had previously noted that Ross \u201cwalked away with a hop in his step.\u201d Conservative Brief <a href=\"https://conservativebrief.com/new-evidence-vindicate-98143/\">went even further</a>, claiming that \u201cforensic evidence and hospital records now corroborate Ross\u2019s account.\u201d No such evidence has been publicly released.</p><p>The administration feeds a claim to a mainstream outlet. The outlet publishes, lending the claim credibility. Government officials and aligned influencers amplify. Right-wing media treats the mainstream report as validation. The claim gets laundered from anonymous leak to established fact, and anyone who questions it can be dismissed as denying what CBS News reported.</p><p>The CBS staffers who raised concerns before publication understood exactly what the story would be used for. They published it anyway.</p><p>And it worked. By the end of the day, \u201cinternal bleeding\u201d had become proof that Good had tried to kill Ross, that the shooting was justified, that the left had been lying all along. The vagueness of the claim was a feature. It could mean anything, which meant it could be made to mean everything.</p><h4>Two stories, two standards</h4><p>It\u2019s worth laying out the contrast directly.</p><p>The CECOT segment was reported by Sharyn Alfonsi, a veteran 60 Minutes correspondent. She had <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/watch-the-60-minutes-segment-cbs\">on-camera interviews</a> with Venezuelan deportees describing torture, beatings, and sexual violence at the hands of prison guards. One of them, Luis Munoz Pinto, was a college student with no criminal record who had been awaiting a decision on his asylum application when he was detained and sent to El Salvador. The segment had gone through every layer of vetting CBS has. It had been <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-kill-switch\">promoted on the network\u2019s social media accounts</a> and on the air. It was, by every measure that\u2019s supposed to matter in television news, ready to go.</p><p>Weiss killed it because the Trump administration wouldn\u2019t provide an on-camera interview. She told staff the segment wasn\u2019t ready, that it didn\u2019t \u201cadvance the ball.\u201d According to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/g-s1-103282/cbs-chief-bari-weiss-pulls-60-minutes-story\">NPR\u2019s reporting</a>, she also objected to the segment\u2019s use of the term \u201cVenezuelan migrants,\u201d preferring \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d the language favored by the administration. Many of the men sent to CECOT weren\u2019t in the country illegally. They had applied for asylum and were waiting for their cases to be decided. Calling them \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d isn\u2019t a neutral editorial choice. It\u2019s adopting the government\u2019s framing as your own.</p><p>Alfonsi pushed back. In <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-kill-switch\">an internal memo</a> to colleagues, she compared the decision to CBS\u2019s 1995 decision to spike an interview with tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand. \u201cCBS spiked the Jeffrey Wigand interview due to legal concerns, nearly destroying the credibility of this broadcast,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt took years to recover from that \u2018low point.\u2019 By pulling this story to shield an administration, we are repeating that history, but for political optics rather than legal ones.\u201d</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dtrn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38ea8887-46ea-4309-95a5-a9ccd773656a_1024x670.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"670\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dtrn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38ea8887-46ea-4309-95a5-a9ccd773656a_1024x670.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1024\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">CBS News anchor Tony Dokoupil interviews people near the site where Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed on January 08, 2026 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Legal experts had called the suit frivolous. CBS\u2019s own attorneys said it was without merit. The network paid anyway. At the time, Paramount was trying to secure regulatory approval for its merger with Skydance, the company run by David Ellison, whose father Larry Ellison is a Trump ally. The approval required sign-off from Trump\u2019s FCC.</p><p>In April 2025, Bill Owens, the executive producer of <em>60 Minutes</em> for over a decade, <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/cbs-news-falls-to-trump-the-shocking\">resigned</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that I\u2019ve become the problem. I am the corporation\u2019s problem,\u201d he told his staff. He said he had \u201clost the independence that honest journalism requires.\u201d</p><p>In October, Paramount announced it had <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/what-happens-when-bad-journalism\">acquired Weiss\u2019s Free Press for $150 million</a> and was installing her as editor-in-chief of CBS News. She would report directly to David Ellison.</p><p>In November, Trump sat down with Norah O\u2019Donnell for a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview. During the conversation, he praised the network\u2019s new leadership. \u201cI think you have a great new leader, frankly, who\u2019s the young woman that\u2019s leading your whole enterprise,\u201d he said, referring to Weiss. \u201cI don\u2019t know her, but I hear she\u2019s a great person.\u201d He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s the greatest thing that\u2019s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.\u201d He also reminded O\u2019Donnell that \u201c60 Minutes paid me a lotta money.\u201d This portion of the interview did not make it into the broadcast.</p><p>What happened after the cameras stopped was revealing. According to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bari-weiss-donald-trump-60-minutes-interview-b2901928.html\">The Independent</a>, citing four people familiar with the situation, Weiss was on location for the interview. When it wrapped, she approached Trump to introduce herself. \u201cHe was so happy to see her and she was so excited to meet him, they both leaned in and exchanged kisses on the cheek,\u201d one source said. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s \u201cjaw dropped,\u201d according to another.</p><p>CBS staffers were not pleased. \u201cI\u2019m still kind of stunned by this,\u201d one reporter told The Independent. \u201cIt reeks of elitism.\u201d Another said: \u201cThat absolutely is not a normal news practice. A firm handshake is an acceptable greeting. It\u2019s wildly inappropriate and presents an overly chummy relationship with the president that no real journalist should or would engage in because it suggests a lack of objectivity.\u201d A former CBS producer said they had \u201cnever kissed a head of state on the cheek before.\u201d</p><p>This is the person who decides what\u2019s ready and what isn\u2019t. This is the person who killed a thoroughly vetted segment about torture because the administration wouldn\u2019t comment, then pushed through an anonymously sourced story her own staff called a propaganda leak.</p><h4>The credibility laundry</h4><p>There\u2019s a reason the Trump administration didn\u2019t leak the \u201cinternal bleeding\u201d claim to Breitbart or the Daily Wire. Those outlets would have run it happily, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. When Matt Walsh says the shooting was justified, his audience already agrees. When RedState celebrates the destruction of the \u201cleftist narrative,\u201d it\u2019s preaching to the choir. The right-wing media ecosystem is effective at energizing people who already believe what it\u2019s selling. It\u2019s less effective at persuading anyone else.</p><p>CBS News is different. For decades, the network has traded on a reputation built by Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite and <em>60 Minutes</em>. When CBS reports something, it carries weight. It gets cited by other outlets. It becomes part of the record. That institutional credibility is worth something. And right now, it\u2019s being spent.</p><p>Consider what happened on January 7, the day of the shooting. <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/for-the-government-the-lie-is-the\">Instantly</a>, the administration had a story ready. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Good had \u201cweaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.\u201d Kristi Noem said agents had been pushing their vehicles out of the snow when Good \u201cattacked them.\u201d Trump posted that Good \u201cviolently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer.\u201d</p><p>The video showed something else. It showed agents approaching Good\u2019s car on a clear street. It showed one of them grabbing her door handle, yelling at her to get out. It showed Ross fire through the windshield. It did not show anyone getting run over. It did not show anyone stuck in snow.</p><p>The administration\u2019s story was falling apart. The video was everywhere. Local officials were contradicting federal claims. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M3GtZ_sqYI\">told ICE to \u201cget the fuck out\u201d</a> of his city and called the self-defense justification \u201cgarbage.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s attorney general was <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2026/1/16/headlines/cbs_news_exclusive_that_ice_officer_suffered_internal_bleeding_draws_huge_internal_concern\">demanding an investigation</a>. The government needed something to change the conversation.</p><p>A week later, CBS gave them \u201cinternal bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Before CBS published, critics of the shooting could point to the video and say: Ross wasn\u2019t run over. He walked away. He drove himself from the scene. He was released from the hospital the same day. Whatever happened, it wasn\u2019t what the government claims.</p><p>After CBS published, defenders of the shooting had a response: He had internal bleeding. CBS News confirmed it. Are you saying CBS is lying? Are you a conspiracy theorist now?</p><p>That lack of specificity is what makes it useful. \u201cInternal bleeding\u201d sounds serious. It sounds like the kind of injury you\u2019d get from being hit by a car. Most people don\u2019t know that a bruise technically qualifies. Most people aren\u2019t going to read the part where CBS\u2019s own senior vice president raised that exact point before publication. They\u2019re going to see the headline, see the CBS logo, and conclude that the government must have been telling the truth after all.</p><p>This is what CBS\u2019s credibility is being used for. Not to inform the public, but to sanitize an administration narrative that was collapsing under the weight of video evidence. Not to report what happened, but to provide cover for people who need the public to stop asking questions.</p><p>David Ellison\u2019s father is one of Trump\u2019s closest allies. Ellison hired Bari Weiss, who killed a story about the administration\u2019s deportation policies because it wasn\u2019t \u201cready.\u201d Now CBS is publishing anonymously sourced claims that its own staff calls propaganda, and those claims are being used by the vice president and the world\u2019s richest man to justify the killing of a 37-year-old American citizen.</p><p>The right doesn\u2019t need CBS to reach its own audience. It needs CBS to reach everyone else. It needs the imprimatur of a mainstream news organization to transform a government talking point into an established fact. Weiss and Ellison are providing that service. They\u2019re laundering narratives that wouldn\u2019t survive scrutiny if they came from anywhere else, and they\u2019re doing it with the credibility that generations of CBS journalists spent their careers building.</p><p>Walter Cronkite signed off every broadcast by saying, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5tdqojA26E\">And that\u2019s the way it is</a>.\u201d I wonder what he\u2019d say about the way it is now.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/what-the-trump-administration-is?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4>What CBS is now</h4><p>A thoroughly reported segment about torture, with on-camera sources and full legal clearance, gets killed because it might upset the administration.</p><p>A thinly sourced claim from anonymous government officials, with no details and no verification and internal objections from the network\u2019s own staff, gets published because the editor-in-chief is interested.</p><p>The first story would have told Americans something true about what their government is doing in their name.

CBS chose what kind of news organization it wants to be, and it made that choice twice in three weeks.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pgvS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf786d9e-409f-4a58-ba72-a71328546b84_1024x674.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pgvS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf786d9e-409f-4a58-ba72-a71328546b84_1024x674.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1024\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Flowers and candles are seen at a vigil for Renee Nicole Good in front of the United States embassy on January 11, 2026 in Berlin, Germany.

They\u2019re the ones who called the internal bleeding story what it was: a thinly-veiled leak designed to justify a killing. They risked their jobs to tell the public that the story they were being asked to publish didn\u2019t meet the standards CBS is supposed to uphold.</p><p>Those people still believe CBS should be something better. They still think the network\u2019s credibility is worth protecting. That\u2019s why they talked.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how many of them are left. I don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ll stay. What I do know is that every time Bari Weiss kills a story the administration doesn\u2019t like, and every time she publishes a story the administration does like, the gap between what CBS claims to be and what CBS actually is gets a little wider. The people who built that institution\u2019s reputation are watching it get strip-mined to serve the interests of a president who once sued the network and now praises its leadership on camera.</p><p>Renee Good was 37 years old. She was a poet, a mother of three. She dropped her six-year-old off at school on January 7 and never came home. An ICE agent shot her in the head.</p><p>The government lied about it. The video proved they lied. And when the lie started to fall apart, CBS helped put it back together.</p><p>That\u2019s the way it is.</p>",
