The line between fact and fantasy continues to blur, but when reality is this negotiable, the soil for preferred futures is fertile. <em>You can just do things.</em> What\u2019s the future you want to see? Making reclaims agency amidst lost meaning. So, don\u2019t escape this reality \u2014 design the one you want.

She was profiled by local newspapers. No one ever heard of such an idea.</p><p>Customers would call her office with their food order. Preferred Dining Service would then place that order with a restaurant, pick it up and then bring it to the customer.</p><p>Suddenly, restaurants in New Jersey could increase their business without having to accommodate more people in their dining room. And suddenly, residents in New Jersey could eat from their favorite restaurants without ever putting on pants.</p><h3>My grandma helped usher in what we now call \u201cfood delivery.\u201d</h3><p>Pizzerias and Chinese restaurants were only just introducing us to delivery in the 60s and 70s, but they were operating logistics themselves, <em>independently</em>. Other cuisine delivery wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar until the 80s and 90s... and a third party bundling all local restaurants together? <em>Unheard of.</em></p><p>Preferred Dining\u2019s delivery men and women dressed as waitstaff and hand delivered fresh restaurant food to late working businessmen and busy housewives in New Jersey... two and a half decades before DoorDash did in Palo Alto.</p><p>But as prescient as my grandma is, the Kleins aren\u2019t billionaires.</p><p>Preferred Dining Service delivered over 5,000 meals before shutting down in less than two years.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N_6k!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c4276d2-a5f4-4ddc-aba3-24cd71049360_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N_6k!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c4276d2-a5f4-4ddc-aba3-24cd71049360_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">1989 coverage in the state-wide New Jersey Star-Ledger</figcaption></figure></div><h2>Is it a Fit?</h2><p>Preferred Dining reveals the importance of Product Market Fit.</p><p>An idea is just that \u2014 <em>an idea</em>. Unless the market demand and the technical environment are ready for whatever you\u2019ve got... better luck later.</p><p>Preferred Dining launched when there were no smartphones, no digital payment systems, no mobile GPS for drivers, and no online restaurant menus or reviews to scroll through.</p><p>These conditions prevented Preferred Dining from ever <em>really</em> taking off.</p><h3>But while Product Market Fit makes or breaks upstarts, there\u2019s another <em>more nuanced</em> condition: Product <em>Culture</em> Fit.</h3><p>If Product <em>Market</em> Fit is about existing infrastructure ensuring blast off, Product <em>Culture</em> Fit signals that culture is ready for new meanings, symbols, and narratives. Does this idea align with social or individual values? Does this story make sense? Is this behavior socially acceptable?</p><p>Preferred Dining exploded... <em>but to an extent</em>. The pitch was at odds with inconducive cultural narratives at the time. Outsourcing a home meal to a restaurant could make one feel lazy. Such uncommon indulgence triggered class anxiety. And dining out was a public performance and opportunity for socialization. At the time, ordering in could feel like a rip off. Same food prices but <em>without</em> the social proof. Turns out over-worked blue-collar workers were Preferred Dining Services\u2019 core customer base \u2014 they couldn\u2019t care less about being seen out.</p><p>But the most critical cultural narrative that Preferred Dining ran up against was \u201c<em>scale</em>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe margins were too small.\u201d My grandma still remembers,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cThe only way this idea could have made sense financially was if we had a bajillion consumers, a bajillion restaurants and a bajillion delivery workers.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>That... and if she was willing to take a larger cut herself and rip off her delivery workforce. Some nights when the phones were lighting up, my grandma hopped in the car to deliver meals herself.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nM2p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5946c8cc-f766-412d-a483-76372343765f_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nM2p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5946c8cc-f766-412d-a483-76372343765f_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The Preferred Dining office</figcaption></figure></div><h2>Define Success</h2><p>In light of Product <em>Culture</em> Fit, what actually changed socially that my grandma failed and DoorDash \u201csucceeded?\u201d</p><p>Well, DoorDash ignored the limitations of scale and ignored shit margins. For over a decade, DoorDash ran at staggering losses, only finally reaching profitability in 2024 \u2014 11 full years after it was founded. It spent $5.9B in venture funding to condition us that 24/7 delivery was <em>possible</em>. DoorDash <em>alone</em> spent over $50M of roughly $200M, lobbying for Prop 22 in California, reshaping labor law to avoid classifying delivery workers as employees.</p><p>DoorDash didn\u2019t wait for Product Culture Fit. They didn\u2019t wait for Americans to believe that $32 burrito limos or exploited, heavily surveilled labor made sense. They didn\u2019t create a <em>business</em>, they created a <em>culture</em>. No meticulously timing trends or leveraging existing cultural norms. <em>They bought them</em>.</p><h3>DoorDash\u2019s biggest success was effectively conditioning millions to see massive delivery fees, fucked up orders and never leaving your home as normal.</h3><p>So maybe it wasn\u2019t that my grandma was ahead of her time.

Culture is written by each of us. Norms are whatever narratives win. Sometimes for better and sometimes for worse. But they\u2019re our own making. Reality isn\u2019t \u201ctruth\u201d winning out. Culture just bends toward whoever shows up. This should empower and motivate us as much as terrify us.</p><p>2. You can just do things. You can just create food delivery. My grandma did. Your ideas are not enough, though. You literally have to roll up your sleeves, dig the dirt and seed your ideas. Put your preferred futures into the world. They\u2019ll grow in ways you\u2019d never expected. Commit. Toil. And sweat. Pollinate responsibly.</p><p>3. The Klein family isn\u2019t worth billions because my grandma learned what DoorDash didn\u2019t. Some ideas are not meant to scale so far and wide. $5.9B to validate an idea with exploitation still as an outcome maybe just isn\u2019t a good idea. <em>I don\u2019t know.</em> The unit economics are nightmarish, the logistics are exhausting, and somehow orders are still consistently late, wrong and cold. DoorDash didn\u2019t spend billions to invent a new idea \u2014 food delivery already existed. They spent it on trying to make math work. <em>Fun.</em></p><p>My grandma learned that reality is writable, but just because you can make reality and that ideas can scale, it doesn\u2019t mean they always <em>should</em>. Thinking on a community-level rather than global one is sometimes necessary. There are harsh tradeoffs to scale: quality, dignity and ethics. This realization and lack of sacrifice, in my eyes, makes my grandma the real successful one here.</p><h3>At the end of the day, you don\u2019t need billions to make or positively influence culture, and spending that much to try to do so likely isn\u2019t a great start.</h3><h3>Instead, you just need the awareness that you too can write any future you want.</h3><p>Change anything.</p><p>Compromise nothing.</p>",

Didn\u2019t they learn anything from the failed Maker Studios acquisition? </p>\n<p>Also, this is the last newsletter for 2025. Look for my \u201cPrediction-ala-palooza on Monday Jan 5th. And look for ME at the 1 Billion Followers Summit later that week, as I\u2019m producing/programming the Economy Track!</p>\n<p>Hello Friends!\u00a0 I\u2019m <strong>Jim Louderback</strong> and this is my weekly creator economy newsletter. If you\u2019ve received it, then you are either subscribed, or someone forwarded it to you.\u2028 If the latter \u2013 and you want to subscribe, <a href=\"https://insidethecreator.beehiiv.com/subscribe\">get it here</a>!</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TOP STORIES</strong></h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>FANDOM WINS</strong></h3>\n<p>Disney just announced a $1B equity investment in OpenAI and a three-year licensing deal that brings 200+ Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars characters into Sora. Some fan-made shorts will even show up on Disney+. This is the next logical step in the creator economy\u2019s evolution from Who to What to You. I wrote about that shift in October: YouTube focused on WHO you liked (creator graph), TikTok owned the topic graph, and now Sora puts you into the video. Expect a flood of fan-fic video stories inspired in part by Kingdom Hearts, whose protagonist is (coincidentally and conveniently) named Sora.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the right move, but I\u2019m still trepidatious. We\u2019ve been down this road before.\u00a0 Disney tried a version of this in 2014 when it bought Maker Studios, betting it could unleash YouTubers on Disney IP. Doomed in part by Maker producing a dozen+ episodes of a Star-Wars related reality show, which allegedly never aired because Maker neglected to vet it with either Disney or Lucas\u2019 brand police.</p>\n<p>OpenAI says it will implement \u201crobust controls.\u201d Disney says, \u201cresponsible use.\u201d We\u2019ll see how that goes, because OpenAI\u2019s guardrails have historically been\u2026 interesting. Either way, Stinky Pete, Roz, and I are going to have an amazing time until it all comes crumbling down.

And by formally labeling the Oracle and Silver Lake deal a \u201cqualified divestiture,\u201d the Trump administration effectively defanged the original bill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>China still hasn\u2019t signed off\u2026 and President Xi\u2019s approval remains the real gate.\u00a0 That leaves TikTok with 38 days before *something* needs to happen. Another extension perhaps?\u00a0 Congressional action is theoretically possible, but in today\u2019s climate, that seems unlikely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have been under the wrong assumption over the past few weeks that this Tuesday was the hard deadline.\u00a0 But until the Oracle and Silver Lake deal is consummated, TikTok US remains in a state of interruptus.\u00a0 My clock has been updated accordingly.\u00a0 (<a href=\"http://tiktokcountdownclock.com/\">TikTok Countdown Clock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance/\">CBS News</a>)</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BEASTLY MISTAKE</strong></h3>\n<p>Another correction from last week.

New research from Sounds Profitable and Signal Hill Insights says we\u2019re already headed there, as 1 in 6 podcast listeners have tried making their own.\u00a0 They also reinforced the inexorable trend towards video with 71% of podcasters doing some form of video.\u00a0 Also, the churn is real. About a third of would-be podcasters have already quit, which creates a surprisingly big untapped market.\u00a0 One more encouraging signal: podcasting looks like it\u2019s getting healthier and more diverse. There\u2019s still a gender gap in who starts, but once people do, retention is basically equal. And multicultural creators appear to stick around and succeed at higher rates overall. (<a href=\"https://soundsprofitable.com/research/the-creators-2025/\">Sounds Profitable</a>)</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Everyone Is a Creator Now, And Commerce Is Tagging Along</strong></h3>\n<p>@Dan Frommer\u2019s latest consumer research has a useful reminder for anyone building in the creator economy. \u201cCreator\u201d is no longer a job title. It\u2019s normal consumer behavior, especially for Gen Z and Millennials. Nearly half self-identify as creators, mostly \u201cfor fun,\u201d and three quarters say it\u2019s a viable career, even though only a small minority will ever turn it into reliable income.\u00a0 Frommer\u2019s research is U.S.-only, but based on my conversations with experts in multiple markets, I hear the same creator-career perceptions almost everywhere.</p>\n<p>His research also shows why creator-led commerce keeps winning. Younger consumers trust creator recommendations more than traditional ads, and when they try creator brands, \u201cgenuine expertise\u201d matters more than simply following the creator. Platforms built around content-to-cart are winning, with TikTok Shop projected to top $15B in US GMV in 2025 and video driving the bulk of sales. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no long tail: The top 1% of TikTok Shop creators drive a majority of sales (when you remove live, product cards, etc).\u00a0 (<a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/8244b7dc-159a-421d-b1d3-5997c75691e1?j=eyJ1IjoiNnF6bSJ9.cWdrEd41rZkmoBBS0L1vgudni7mETwp7C5bBQ3BuF6A\">New Consumer</a>)</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>WHERE\u2019s JIM?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019M A STAR! </strong>So proud to be immortalized in the latest episode of Alan\u2019s Universe!\u00a0 Thanks Alan and Chelsea and all of the Creator Week Macao team for making this magic moment happen.\u00a0 (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/HXpt8JMS53Y?si=1TV99t2u8jdysqCx\">YouTube</a>)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"358\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpeg?resize=560%2C358&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"560\"/></figure></div>\n<p>See you in Dubai in January!</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p>Like this free newsletter?\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jlouderb\">Buy me a coffee</a> and say thanks!\u00a0 Or let\u2019s do a meetup in your town.</p>\n<p>100% written by me.\u00a0 AI used very sparingly for edits.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve built and sold multiple creator economy startups to top media companies \u2013 including an MCN to Discovery and VidCon to Paramount. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/build-relation/newsletter-follow/?entityUrn=6762441989427478528\">Subscribe here on LinkedIn</a> to get this newsletter every Monday.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think \u2013 email me at <a href=\"mailto:jim@louderback.com\">jim@louderback.com</a>.
