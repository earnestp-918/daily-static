You should a) submit, and b) come!</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>1.0 Some Things That Caught My Attention</h1>\n<h2>1.1 Things Could Have Been Different</h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s the line of thinking that led to today\u2019s main Thing That Caught My Attention:</p>\n<p>Via the Orange Place, Saigoneer reported that Vietnam has banned unskippable ads - so <em>every</em> ad has to be skippable after five seconds<sup id=\"fnref:skip\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:skip\">1</a></sup>,<sup id=\"fnref:skip2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:skip2\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>I am now old and cynical, so I don\u2019t think something like this could ever come about in the U.S. The closest we might get to legislation around skippable ads might be if California decides to do something about it, but, well, see the next para.</p>\n<p>The general <em>vibe</em> of competition law and consumer protection in the U.S. is in general \u201clet corporations do what they want if it results in cheaper prices, or if we can some way persuade ourselves that consumers have the ability to pay less\u201d. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether the level of service is degraded, it doesn\u2019t matter if there happens to be what might appear to be collusion and suddenly while you\u2019re paying less, every single player in a particular space has taken away a particularly consumer friendly feature. The rough competitive pressure is to reduce costs and increase profit, right? </p>\n<p>In this way, streaming services that distinguished themselves when they started by <em>not</em> having ads (because like premium tv channels, their model was subscription fees and not advertising money) have, now that they\u2019ve built up a large enough consumer base, decided that actually it\u2019s okay to run ads now because, well, what are you going to do? <em>Not</em> use a streaming service? One of the arguments that streaming services succeeded in the first place was that they made it significantly easier to watch tv and movies than pirating them, and sure, that\u2019s true too. That falls in the bucket of \u201coffered a better alternative experience of watching tv and movies\u201d. </p>\n<p>So one streaming service starts adding ads and then adds a more expensive ad-free tier. Your choices are now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pay more to get the same service (i.e. ad free)</li>\n<li>pay less to get a different and arguably less pleasant experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is \u201cgood\u201d because now you have a choice. It makes the product available to more people, which is also \u201cgood\u201d. It means the streaming service has the opportunity for more revenue, which means the streaming service also has the opportunity (which it does not have to take!) to invest more of its profits into content creation [sic], which is \u201cgood\u201d for consumers because that means there\u2019s more content that you can choose from (never mind that the content that\u2019s created will not be licensed to third parties, and will be exclusive to that streaming service).</p>\n<p>Forgive me for thinking that these choices don\u2019t <em>feel</em> like they\u2019re real choices. I don\u2019t <em>want</em> to pay less to see ads. I want what I had in the first place.</p>\n<p>So I imagine that, with better sources, and with the help of a few clerks, I could totally write an opinion or an argument that says: hey, legislating for unskippable ads is counter to our established law and precedent regarding consumer protection and competition. It would unfairly and unnecessarily restrain commercial providers from offering products and services that would benefit consumers. So if California <em>were</em> to legislate for this, I can imagine California getting smacked down.</p>\n<p>But then I am cynical, and perhaps too much so.</p>\n<p>Okay, so that\u2019s the background, and how I get to this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Far from disrupting power structures, the rise and spread of consumer technology over the last thirty years has on balance done more to make power easier to grow, concentrate, and defend<sup id=\"fnref:quote\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:quote\">3</a></sup> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying this consumer technology <em>hasn\u2019t</em> disrupted power structures. It has! There are definitely examples of bottom-up and middle-out disruptions thanks to consumer technology. I will point to things like bottom-up surveillance and documentation of police brutality. I will also point to groups self-organizing over the internet to achieve political aims, whether that\u2019s taking over school districts to ban books, or to achieve local transport improvements. </p>\n<p>But in comparison to the promise of that technology, which <em>could</em> have lead to disruption of power structures, that technology could only have ever worked within the envelope of society. There was a window of change -- and the most recent window felt like during COVID where for a bright shining second it felt like maybe people were realizing landlords and land ownership in the way it\u2019s enabled and practiced now might be a bad idea? -- and it feels like that window has now passed.</p>\n<p>The disruptions afforded by consumer tech feel insignificant in the face of macro changes, almost a sort of let-them-eat-cake of internet. (I am sure that people like Cory Doctorow will loudly disagree with me, and I love Cory for it because I wish I also shared his energy and optimism)</p>\n<p>This technology (billions of people with the power of self-publishing from mobile networked devices) could\u2019ve been a massive change but instead was used to preserve  and reinforce existing power structures. The tech was only ever a tool. </p>\n<p>We <em>could</em> have decided to use it different. We could <em>still</em> decide to use it differently. One example of how tech could be used to disrupt power is from, I think, Switzerland, where <em>one person</em> wrote a script that scraped online grocery stores and found evidence of price collusion, I think. The government department responsible for making sure that didn\u2019t happen a) wasn\u2019t doing that, b) ended up asking if they could use it so they could become more effective at enforcement. </p>\n<p>Put it this way: the private sector is happily bringing about dynamic pricing to squeeze the most profit out of you (see Wegman\u2019s in New York adding facial recognition tech, airlines switching to personalized pricing) which requires <em>scads</em> of data to do well (or conversely, just do it badly and still make as much money), but <em>government</em> is politically restrained from using technology in such a manner to enforce <em>existing legislation</em>. That\u2019s a choice! A societal choice! And when the choice benefits those in power, well, the simplest answer is that that\u2019s why the choice was made. </p>\n<p>All of this is hilarious because of the growth and development of technology in the first place as a means of administering bureaucracy (yes I see you all waving your copies of <em>Seeing Like a State</em>). I will tell my story again of EHRs evolving first from <em>billing systems</em>, not technology systems devoted to managing towards better care outcomes [sic]. </p>\n<p>We could have had a different future. We might still, perhaps things haven\u2019t gotten bad enough yet to change.</p>\n<h2>1.1 LLMs as LitTech, Their Use as Response to Mass Functional Illiteracy</h2>\n<p>I will start with some of the interesting bits first to get your attention before diving into the story and thinking-out-loud.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am calling generative AI for text (LLMs, Chatbots etc) LiteracyTech</li>\n<li>LiteracyTech because they are assistive technologies for people with low literacy/low functional literacy</li>\n<li>LiteracyTech itself is a symptom -- a response to the failure of education systems to prepare people to live in a world of complicated text</li>\n<li>In other words, people use LiteracyTech because they have a functional literacy disability</li>\n<li>This is horrifying</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay, how did I get here?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a TikTok I saw the other day where I think this is happening -- a woman is checking out a prospective date. One of the criteria she\u2019s using is to see how well he copes with reading out loud a paragraph (I think of her choosing) of text. He struggles with it, stumbling over certain words, before essentially rage quitting (e.g. \u201cfuck this\u201d). </p>\n<p>The comments are broadly supportive, with similar stories (one from someone who was dating a guy who had a masters in a science subject, a six figure salary but \u201ctook as long to read a paragraph as I did a page\u201d), and also the converse, pointing out that the test is biased at least in one respect against people who have literacy disabilities. I think that\u2019s entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p>(The other day I also mentioned that my kid and his friends (11-14 year-olds) are pretty dismissive if not outright disdainful of generative AI and slop. I wonder how much this has to do with the fact that they read a lot?)</p>\n<p>Look, I know there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s problematic about this supposed test someone\u2019s doing of whether someone is dateable. What I\u2019m interested in is more the signals from the guy: it felt like the way he ragequit was honestly because he was ashamed and embarrassed, being shown up, and being judged. I don\u2019t think he knew he was being filmed for public consumption at the time. </p>\n<p>We (western societies) like to hold literacy to such a degree that <em>not</em> being literate I think oscillates between something people are ashamed of, to then wearing or reclaiming as a badge of pride. I think this is also where a lot of sentiment about and against so-called elites comes from in the U.S. </p>\n<p>I digress. </p>\n<p>I imagine one way that \u201cmen\u201d feel shit about themselves in the loneliness epidemic, entitlement, going nutso radicalized sense is that the education system has failed them specifically in the space of literacy. I mean I know everyone will say \u201cbut yes education systems have failed the boys who have become men\u201d and I don\u2019t want to open Pandora\u2019s culture war jar. </p>\n<p>So <em>no wonder</em> there are apps for summarizing books into 5 minute reads, or bullet points. No wonder people are so into LLM summarization if reading is so hard in the first place. </p>\n<p>Say you had a whole generation -- or even more than a whole generation -- that had been completely fucked over by the inexplicable and inexcusable introduction of three-cueing as a method of teaching reading.</p>\n<p>(Three-cueing is the one where you\u2019re supposed to learn how to read by using context: what word would make sense here, what word would sound right here, and what word looks right based on the letter and surrounding illustration. It\u2019s shit. It doesn\u2019t work. It makes things worse)</p>\n<p>Say that generation had drastically lower levels of literacy than previous (or even following) generations. It would be reasonable for people to feel stupid. </p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how we end up with reading apps.</p>\n<p>And if you think about things that way (and also, fair warning! I am thinking by the skin of my pants!), then LLMs are an assistive technology for dealing with an induced disability (is that a thing? Like, a taught disability? Or a reading deficiency that might just be down to bad instruction?). </p>\n<p>How about this: people who are using LLMs are judged by those who do not because of the belief that <em>you should be able to read and write</em>. But it\u2019s <em>not your fault</em> that you can\u2019t read and write well enough: that was the responsibility of the state through the education system. And anyway, <em>you were a kid!</em>.</p>\n<p>(There is a <em>very</em> problematic part here about the lengths to which immigrants will go to learn English as a second language and a whole deal with privilege. I\u2019ll say that people have the entirely reasonable belief that because they went through an educational system and didn\u2019t flame out that they <em>shouldn\u2019t</em> need remedial education in reading and writing, and that to suggest so is pretty much an insult)</p>\n<p>So I think there could be this mismatch in the expected level of attainment of literacy. You might genuinely have the position that if the state did its job and everyone was at a level n of literacy then you\u2019d expect people of any level less than n to need assistive tools. But what if your assumption about the proportion of people who\u2019ve reached level n is way off? </p>\n<p>This line of thought just makes me sad. Sad for people because so much potential is wasted. Sad on the second order because we could be using all those tflops for something else. Sad because being literate, I think, allows for such a richer life and experience. </p>\n<p>Read this in my \u201cha ha joking but not really\u201d tone, but if you allow for the existing of literacytech then alongside Grammarly you also get a sort of Duolingo-but-for-English-for-Native-English-Speakers which again is a combination of horrifying and sad. The difference of course being that you\u2019d need I think to trick people who are too proud into using Duolingo-but-for-functional-English-literacy.</p>\n<p>So I am not surprised at the usage of LLMs for reading, writing, and summarizing. I am not surprised when you consider that 40% of Americans read zero books in 2025, and that you get better at reading by practising reading, and that you get better at writing by reading more. I would not be surprised if there\u2019s a correlation between the 19% of Americans who read over 10 books in 2025 and the people who generally hold the opinion that LLMs and using them is Bad and we should Kill Them With Fire.</p>\n<p>But -- and I know this is kind of unhelpful -- I think this framing helps explain <em>why</em> so many people are using them, and at the same time unhelpfully points out that \u201cbanning LLMs\u201d isn\u2019t great on one axis because what if this LitTech <em>is</em> an assistive technology? Then do we get into the exciting moral argument of \u201cwell is it okay if it\u2019s this environmentally responsible\u201d and \u201cwell is it okay if it\u2019s built on the back of extracting value from peoples\u2019 work?\u201d and \u201cbut isn\u2019t it run by a problematic power structure\u201d to which you\u2019re just one Beetlejuice away from summoning \u201cso you\u2019re refusing medical treatment because of Nazi human experimentation, no don\u2019t go away, <em>I\u2019m just asking questions</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>So I am <em>sympathetic</em>. People are getting real value out of these tools. You might call someone lazy for using them, but am I being lazy when I wear glasses instead of just getting up close so I can see things? No, Dan, that is a stupid argument and I won\u2019t entertain it. But laziness <em>is</em> a moral judgment. It is distinct from \u201cI am living in a ruthless economy and society and barely have enough time and energy to get by so will take the shortest route which is using this app instead of going to a community college and improving my literacy skills\u201d. (And that costs time! And money!)</p>\n<p>I mean, you could ban them anyway. But I don\u2019t think that would mean anything without dealing with the underlying issues and at some point you just end up waving your hands around and saying \u201ceverything is systemically fucked, where would you even start, and change would take so long I would be doing it <em>for those who come after</em> and not myself\u201d. </p>\n<p>So. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>LLMs are LitTech</li>\n<li>The emergence and mass usage of LitTech is a symptom of and response to an epidemic of low functional literacy in a world getting ever more complicated</li>\n<li>LitTech as assistive technology</li>\n<li>LLMs aren\u2019t going to go away, precisely because they\u2019re being used as an assistive technology</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, one last thing. In retrospect, in a world where \u201c... for Dummies\u201d books exist and from memory took up a fair amount of precious retail space back when we used to go to stores to buy books, I think it makes sense (and confirms my biases that should be validated!) that there\u2019s such a latent need for accessible text.</p>\n<p>(I know that there\u2019s a difference between accessible text and accurate accessible text. Let\u2019s set that aside)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>That\u2019s it.

He\u2019s often depicted with an eye patch or an empty socket. But what happened to poor old Odin\u2019s eye? In his obsessive hunt for wisdom, he discovered Mimir\u2019s Well, a sacred spring rumored to hold infinite knowledge. But it came at a terrible price. <a href=\"https://www.voluspa.org/voluspa26-30.htm\">Odin gouged out his own eye</a>, ripped it clean out of his skull, and tossed it into the well for a single drink. With that sip, infinite knowledge flooded into him. He traded partial blindness for a different form of perception. But even with all this knowledge, Odin was the god of war, frenzy and madness.</p><p>In 1942, Jorge Luis Borges told the story of \u201c<a href=\"https://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf\">Funes The Memorious</a>,\u201d who, after a horseback riding accident, gained perfect, total, infinite memory. But what seemed like a gift quickly became a curse. Infinite information utterly overwhelmed him. He couldn\u2019t think, speak or live normally. The infinite didn\u2019t expand his world. It crushed him.</p><p>In 1964, X-Men introduced <a href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Cerebro\">Cerebro</a>, a supercomputer that connects the mind of the user to every single mutant on Earth all at once. But this is lethal to the untrained mind. It instantly invites infinite noise directly into the user\u2019s brain, causing extreme psychic overload, even coma or death.</p><p>In every myth, the lesson is the same: <em>The path to the infinite is the path to madness.</em></p><p>And yet, we still gouge out our eyes. We plug our untrained minds into the infinite machines \u2013 our smartphones, our social media, our Oura rings, our prediction markets, and our AIs. And as a result, we are going mad.</p><h3><strong>02.</strong></h3><h3><strong>THE MIND THAT ENTERS LIMITLESS TERRAIN WITH LIMITED CAPACITY INVITES DEFEAT</strong></h3><p>William James, one of the fathers of psychology, once <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57628/57628-h/57628-h.htm\">wrote</a>,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cAttention is the taking possession by the mind.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>So what, exactly, are we allowing to take possession of <em>our</em> minds?</p><p>We are not built for the infinite. The human brain is powerful, but <em>finite</em>. And our attentional capacity is a limited resource. Nelson Cowan, a leading researcher on working memory, tells us the Magic Number is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11515286/\">4\u00b11</a>. Meaning, we can only focus our attention on three to five meaningful chunks of information before our cognitive capacity overflows. Now, how does that compare to the number of tabs you have open right now? The number of TikToks you\u2019ve scrolled today? The number of unread emails sitting in your inbox?</p><p>When we exceed the Magic Number, we risk <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39278166/\">ego depletion</a>. When our cognitive load becomes too high, our self-control depletes. We become a soft target \u2013 more impulsive, more predisposed to reach for short-term gratification, distractions, rage bait, junk food, gambling and buying more things we don\u2019t actually need.</p><p>But what about paying constant attention to the things that <em>really</em> matter? Global crises, suffering, injustice? Isn\u2019t it our duty to care for our brethren?</p><p>Noble, yes, but there\u2019s a paradox here. The more suffering we try to <em>absorb</em>, the less we\u2019re able to <em>act</em>. This is called <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/7/19/15925506/psychic-numbing-paul-slovic-apathy\">psychic numbing</a>. Compassion fatigue. It\u2019s a defense mechanism where empathy and the ability to respond collapses as the scale of tragedy increases. The mind can\u2019t metabolize the infinite, so it shuts down. This is why a single person\u2019s story can sometimes move millions more effectively than statistics of mass suffering. Even Mother Teresa, the saint herself, has <a href=\"https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/journal/7303a/jdm7303a.htm\">said</a>,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cIf I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t care, but because the infinite exceeds the limits of human capacity.</p><h3><strong>03.</strong></h3><h3><strong>THE FIELD OF ATTENTION IS THE FIELD OF REALITY</strong></h3><p>Our attention deserves protection, because our attention is our reality.</p><p>Remember the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo\">Invisible Gorilla Test</a>? People watch a video of players passing a basketball and are told to count the passes. While they\u2019re focused on counting, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the scene. Afterward, when asked, \u201cDid you catch the gorilla?\u201d most people never noticed it. The test reveals how easily our visual field and perception fail based on how and where we pay attention.</p><p>Attention is our field of view \u2013 the small slice of the world that our mind chooses to look at.</p><p>That field of view becomes our reality tunnel \u2013 a narrow corridor carved by what holds our focus, shaping what we notice and, equally, what we miss. That reality tunnel becomes our perceived reality \u2013 the world we believe we\u2019re in, simply because it\u2019s the only world we\u2019re seeing. And our perceived reality becomes our lived action \u2013 it dictates how we move, what we choose, who we become.</p><p>We must strategically protect and take aim with our attention, not just because it\u2019s the lens through which we see, but because it\u2019s the architecture of our reality.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3R-1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58a306a-17a7-48d4-aefc-8640d7a7b94e_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3R-1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58a306a-17a7-48d4-aefc-8640d7a7b94e_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>04.</strong></h3><h3><strong>KNOW THY ENEMY: A 24/7 CULTURE WITHOUT REST</strong></h3><p>How did we even get here? How did we begin to desire and attempt to pay attention to the infinite, which consistently defeats us?</p><p>Much of the current discourse would blame our collapse of attention, and with it, shared reality, on modern technologies \u2013 smartphones, social media, algorithms, AI. But the attention war began <em>long</em> before any of that.</p><p>Art critic Jonathan Crary\u2019s book <em><a href=\"https://xenopraxis.net/readings/crary_247.pdf\">24/7</a></em> explores how we entered a culture that battles against rest and time itself. A nonstop 24/7 culture that never turns off. If attention is finite, a 24/7 society fights to expand the surface area of waking time to capture more of it.</p><p>Reed Hastings has famously stated that Netflix\u2019s main competition isn\u2019t other media or entertainment companies.<em> <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition\">It\u2019s sleep</a>.</em></p><p>This acceleration really took off with cable news and the birth of CNN in 1980. TV news and programming stopped ending with nightly sign-offs. It stopped syncing with the rhythms of our sleep cycles. Media became an <em>infinite</em> loop of endless, real-time information.</p><p>There have been even stranger attempts to literally extend our daylight. In 1993, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-russian-space-mirror-briefly-lit-night-180957894/\">Russia\u2019s Znamya project</a> sent mirrored satellites into orbit to try to reflect sunlight back onto Earth to increase the time and attention available for productivity.</p><p>Our culture tempts us to strive for an aspirational identity rooted in infinite information and the illusion of potential mastery over it.</p><p>But there is no endpoint, only an ever-growing stream of content. We face a nonstop 24/7 loop of madness.</p><h3><strong>05.</strong></h3><h3><strong>THAT WHICH SEEKS ATTENTION CANNOT BE DEFEATED BY GIVING IT ATTENTION</strong></h3><p>Information expands to fill the space available, and in our 24/7 culture and modern media environment, the space available is infinite. This means there are now more news stories than there is actual news. W. David Marx calls this the <a href=\"https://culture.ghost.io/only-fads-a-culture-and-economy-of-labubu/\">Parkinson\u2019s Law of Media</a>.</p><p>Marx argues that ad-driven platforms financially incentivize all media \u2013 and at this point, nearly every company and person <em>is</em> media \u2013 to endlessly react and reproduce more media on anything that trends. The tiniest spark of a story can quickly explode into what feels like a full-blown cultural atomic bomb.</p><p>Further, Marx explains that the aspirational identity around media literacy has drifted toward a belief that we must remain fluent in every single thing online \u2013 high culture, low culture, things we love, things we hate. This traps us in an endless chase to consume <em>every. single. narrative.</em></p><p>But by the time we\u2019re arguing about whether something is real or fake, good or bad, important or meaningless, the battle is already lost. The attention war itself won, and we are the spoils.</p><p>Personalities, products, and subcultures win simply by demanding attention, even from their haters. This creates a hyperstitious loop. Debate and critique disproportionately amplify the very thing we hope to squash, pushing it further into existence and significance through repetition.</p><p>In <em>The Art of Wa</em>r, Sun Tzu wrote,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cDo not swallow bait offered by the enemy.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://nicksusi.substack.com/p/magic-online\">We cannot defeat that which seeks attention by any means necessary by giving it attention.</a> This is the paradox at the heart of the attention war.</p><h3><strong>06.</strong></h3><h3><strong>THE DIGITAL REALM APPEARS INFINITE TO THE EYE BUT IS FINITE IN DEPTH</strong></h3><p>Modern technology makes it feel like we possess infinite knowledge at our fingertips. But that\u2019s not true.</p><p>Our online environments only <em>appear</em> infinite. The deepest, most nuanced knowledge still lives beyond any device. Everything we see through search, social media, or AI is limited to what has already been indexed, posted or trained. For example, Google may index hundreds of billions of web pages, yet that still accounts for <a href=\"https://neoncentury.com/why-cant-search-engines-access-the-deep-web/\">&lt;5%</a> of the internet. The rest sits in the <em>deep web</em> \u2013 private information, profiles, messages and spaces locked behind passwords, paywalls and encryption \u2013 <em>unreachable</em>. Also consider all knowledge that\u2019s never been coded, or cannot be coded by a machine.</p><p>So both things are true at once: the internet is both too large for any one person to fully grasp in their lifetime, and yet that internet is still nowhere close to a true reflection of all our human knowledge.</p><p>To be clear, this doesn\u2019t mean these technological gateways <em>aren\u2019t</em> extraordinary. They expand our minds in ways no past generation could ever have imagined. But reality can\u2019t be fully understood without curiously wandering beyond a feed and paying attention to the physical world, to people, places and knowledge <em>uncaptured</em> by the internet.</p><p>Randonautica is a viral app with a cult-like following that launched in 2020 (h/t <a href=\"https://zine.kleinkleinklein.com/p/friction\">Ruby Justice Thelot</a>). Users set an intention, and the app generates random nearby coordinates for them to explore in the physical world. The idea is to alter one\u2019s reality by breaking out of their <em>existing</em> reality tunnel and pushing them into unexpected experiences. The app became infamous after some people stumbled into unsettling situations, including one case in Seattle where <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/life/how-does-randonautica-work-the-creepy-tiktok-famous-app-can-help-you-realize-intentions-27624516\">teens found human remains</a> near a Randonautica location.</p><p>But does the app actually <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaemanuel/randonautica-freaky-coincidences\">alter reality</a>? Or is it that once users set an intention, enter a new environment, and tune their attention, they simply notice <em>different</em> patterns and assign <em>new</em> meaning to what was always there? Much like the gorilla and basketballs, what we notice depends on what we\u2019re primed to see. \u201cTouch grass\u201d isn\u2019t just a cute meme. It\u2019s a reminder to break the 24/7 infinite loop and widen our aperture of attention so our field of reality expands.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B7We!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2faf0e0c-d4c4-4d19-8571-dfb5f5a61906_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B7We!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2faf0e0c-d4c4-4d19-8571-dfb5f5a61906_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>07.</strong></h3><h3><strong>TO MISTAKE THE STAGE FOR THE WORLD IS BE TO CONQUERED</strong></h3><p>Even within the limited reflection of the physical world that we see online, there\u2019s no guarantee that any of it is <em>real</em>. As Sun Tzu says,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cAll warfare is based on deception.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>The idea that people perform for each other isn\u2019t new. In 1956, half a century before the launch of Facebook, sociologist Erving Goffman pioneered the <a href=\"https://monoskop.org/images/1/19/Goffman_Erving_The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life.pdf\">dramaturgical approach</a> to viewing social life as theater. He viewed each of us as actors, playing roles on a public front stage to shape how others perceive us, and then retreating to the backstage of our private lives. In our current social media era, we\u2019re more aware than ever that <em>everyone</em> is performing. Yet this awareness doesn\u2019t seem to make us any less <em>susceptible</em> to staged performance, or curbs us for performing <em>ourselves</em>. Even authenticity is now a performance and manufactured aesthetic.</p><p>Much of the current discourse is <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@megameme__/video/7576771220264258830\">panic</a> about reality collapsing every time a photorealistic image generated by Nano Banana goes viral. But the challenge of discerning what\u2019s real online has existed for far longer than debates about generative AI or the authenticity of images.</p><p>Even those who preach media literacy and cultural fluency still fall for these traps. They believe information is staged when it isn\u2019t, like the claim that <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@himollysl/video/7322612091490176302\">HBO engineered</a> \u201cthe mob-wife aesthetic\u201d trend as a psyop for the 25th anniversary of <em>The Sopranos</em>. They in fact <em><a href=\"https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2024/01/26/hbo-max-mob-wife-aesthetic-marketing-strategy\">did not</a></em>. And they believe information is real that is actually staged, like <a href=\"https://itscharlibb.substack.com/p/the-realities-of-being-a-pop-star\">Charli XCX joining Substack</a> to journal about the realities of being a pop star, which in reality is a professional entertainer being paid to strategically use the aesthetics of raw confessionals as an ad for both the platform and her upcoming album.</p><p>None of this would matter if we treated the online as an entertainment stage, a series of magic tricks, a <em>dreamworld</em>. Charli herself acknowledges the fun in blurring the lines between truth and performance. But reality becomes strange when we continuously mistake performance for truth and pass it around as insightful cultural signal. Much of today\u2019s commentary now looks less like real cultural analysis and more like white collar fan fiction and conspiracy theories about what\u2019s happening \u201cbackstage.\u201d</p><p>At the end of the day, we\u2019re all putting on a front stage performance that\u2019s shaping real life decisions, but many are forgetting it\u2019s all just an act. As a result, even among people who claim to defend media literacy, we\u2019re losing our grip on what\u2019s real and what\u2019s a performance.</p><h3><strong>08.</strong></h3><h3><strong>REALITY IS NOT COLLAPSING, BUT CONSTANTLY RECOMPOSING</strong></h3><p>Our shared sense of reality is always shifting. It has always gone through cycles of breaking apart and coming back together in new forms.</p><p>Venkatesh Rao argues that we don\u2019t live in one \u201creal world,\u201d but in near infinite overlapping belief-worlds \u2013 different religions, fandoms, economic theories, political ideologies. The \u201creal world\u201d is simply the dozen or so belief-worlds that are <a href=\"https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/this-is-the-new-real-world\">most </a><em><a href=\"https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/this-is-the-new-real-world\">consequential</a></em> at a given moment. Only a few meaningful stories shape history, and even <em>those</em> rise and fall as collective belief changes. Power, wealth, popularity, or even truth don\u2019t guarantee that a world matters. Only <em>consequentiality</em> does. As Ana\u00efs Nin said,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cWe do not see the world as it is, but as we are.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>Rao gives the example of Galileo vs. the Catholic Church. In the 17th century, Galileo was right that the sun doesn\u2019t revolve around the Earth as the center of the universe, but the Church\u2019s constructed world was more dominant and <em>consequential</em> than his truth. Galileo\u2019s true world didn\u2019t become consequential until many centuries and technological developments later. It wasn\u2019t until about 350 years later in 1992 that the Vatican <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/world/after-350-years-vatican-says-galileo-was-right-it-moves.html\">formally acknowledged</a> the Catholic Church\u2019s error in condemning Galileo. <em>Oops.</em></p><p>So what we call the \u201creal world,\u201d our shared social reality, is really just a temporary construction which lasts only as long as enough people believe in it. Reality is in constant negotiations. When belief fades, that world dissolves and a new one forms. Today, for example, we can see the neoliberal world losing consequentiality, while the worlds of Trump, mysticism and the accelerating AI arms race rise.</p><p>Understanding reality isn\u2019t about infinitely chasing truth with our finite attention. It\u2019s about understanding <em>which</em> worlds are becoming more or less <em>consequential</em>.</p><p>Perhaps part of why we experience reality collapse is that 24/7 media and infinite access to information allow us see <em>more</em> of these worlds rising, falling, and recomposing. The churn was always happening. We just couldn\u2019t access it in real time... <em>until now.</em></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RQZy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24efd38f-e185-406c-b8fb-bf9c8b2dd546_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RQZy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24efd38f-e185-406c-b8fb-bf9c8b2dd546_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>09.</strong></h3><h3><strong>VICTORY BELONGS TO HE WHO KNOWS LIMITED ATTENTION IS NOT A WEAKNESS BUT A STRENGTH</strong></h3><p>Sun Tzu himself wrote,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cIf he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>Even Sun Tzu understood that finite resources must be spent wisely. The same law governs the attention war. Survival isn\u2019t just about what you focus on. It\u2019s about what you deliberately <em>refuse</em> to focus on.</p><p><em>Restraint</em> is a winning strategy.</p><p>Limiting our attention is not a weakness. It\u2019s how we maintain mental fortitude.</p><p><em>Move on.</em></p><h3><strong>10.</strong></h3><h3><strong>MASTERY BEGINS WITH TRIAGING WHAT CAN BE CONTROLLED AND WHAT IS DISTRACTION</strong></h3><p>So how does a soldier navigate the battlefield of attention?</p><p>It begins with a system of triage.</p><p>Looking at the work of psychologist Julian Rotter, we must ask, what is in our <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-19211-001\">locus of </a><em><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-19211-001\">control</a></em>? I.e. What can I directly act on right now? What is in our locus of <em>influence</em>. I.e. What can I not control, but can affect over time? What is in our locus of <em>concern</em>? I.e. What are the things I deeply care about, but cannot meaningfully change? And what is in our zone to <em>ignore</em>? I.e. What is everything outside my knowledge and reach, which I must accept I don\u2019t and can\u2019t fully know?</p><p>In our current 24/7 culture and relationship with media, we\u2019ve become so disembodied from our physical surroundings. In a weightless state, it\u2019s become much harder to discern what is actually within our control or influence, our inner locus, and what\u2019s actually materially <em>consequential</em> to our lives.</p><p>Instead, so many of us get stuck endlessly in the outer locus of concern \u2013 the areas far outside our control or influence \u2013 expending scarce attention on things we dislike, can\u2019t meaningfully affect, or don\u2019t even need to have an opinion on. We form opinions about <em>everything</em>, unable to have an informed opinion about anything.</p><p><a href=\"https://summerofprotocols.com/artificial-memory-web\">Francis Bacon</a> warned that when we have no clear \u201cprenotion or perception of what we are seeking, we seek and toil and wander aimlessly, as if in infinite space. Whereas, if we have a particular prenotion, infinity is at once interrupted.\u201d When our attention narrows, we can move forward with purpose.</p><p>Nietzsche, in <em>On the Use and Abuse of History for Life</em>, argued that <a href=\"https://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEENietzscheAbuseTableAll.pdf\">active selective </a><em><a href=\"https://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEENietzscheAbuseTableAll.pdf\">forgetting</a></em> is essential for life itself. That without the ability to let go of the infinite, action becomes <em>impossible</em>. He warns that the infinite overwhelms the present and weakens vitality, and that every living being needs a limited horizon.</p><p>To be very clear, this is not about anti-technology or anti-ambition. It is pro-focus, pro-intention, and pro-discernment in how we understand broader historical contexts and apply the affordances of modern technology and media to our own ambitions. This is a call to reclaim our attention as a finite, precious resource.</p><h3><strong>11.</strong></h3><h3><strong>STRATEGIC FOCUS IS NOT STRATEGIC IGNORANCE</strong></h3><p>Now, to be clear, there is a dark side in shifting from the infinite to the finite.</p><p>We risk an overcorrection to an overcorrection. We can turn too far inward, toward isolation, narcissism, echo chambers, tribalism, xenophobia, and authoritarian nationalism. We\u2019re already feeling these worlds gaining consequentiality today.</p><p>But strategic <em>focus</em> is not the same as strategic <em>ignorance</em>. In <em>The Unknowers: How Strategic Ignorance Rules The World</em>, sociologist Linsey McGoey warns about <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Unknowers.html?id=-YJb0QEACAAJ\">ostrich instruction</a>, dissociating and claiming ignorance to absolve one\u2019s self of responsibility, like the myth of an ostrich burying its head in the sand.</p><p>The flood of infinite information leaves us overwhelmed, manipulated, and exhausted. <em>It\u2019s a lot.</em> Limiting what we take in defends us \u2013 <em>but</em> only if we retain self-awareness and humility of what we don\u2019t know, and stay curious and humble enough to learn from perspectives outside our immediate field of view. There is much that we don\u2019t know and can\u2019t affect.</p><p>This is permission to find comfort in knowing that we cannot, and will not, know or change <em>everything</em>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DsFv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd773e0c3-b69c-45c2-bcac-9031cc664aee_1280x107.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"107\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DsFv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd773e0c3-b69c-45c2-bcac-9031cc664aee_1280x107.png\" style=\"\" width=\"1280\"/><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Good luck out there, soldier.</p><p>As your eyes wander from here to the next patch of digital terrain, will you march forward with intention, tighten your grip on your attention, and ask yourself, why are you here?</p><p>Now, move out and on.</p>",
