Apparently there were visible aurora last night, but I was too busy being asleep. </p>\n<p>A long one, today.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>1.0 Some Things That Caught My attention</h1>\n<h1>1.1 The Collapse of Form</h1>\n<p>I was reading Paul Musgrave\u2019s newsletter of today<sup id=\"fnref:musgrave\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:musgrave\">1</a></sup> on amongst other things the Mark Carney-saying-out-loud that the old international world order is dead, that Trump has kicked them all over, and that it\u2019s time for the rest of the world to deal with an antagonistic and yet still fairly predictable and dangerous toddler. (Predictable in the sense that he\u2019s capricious and in it for himself, and like I wrote elsewhere, exceedingly goal-oriented and method-agnostic).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I ended up reading Musgrave\u2019s issue on the decline (or collapse?) of the literate society<sup id=\"fnref:literate\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:literate\">2</a></sup>, and it put a few things into clear perspective for me. Here\u2019s what caught my attention:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A speedy dismissal of the \u201cadults have always complained about kids since the days of Socrates\u201d due to the specificity and consistency of current complaints/issues;</li>\n<li>the difference (and here I trust Musgrave) between a class where 70% of the students have done 50% of the reading and what\u2019s alleged to be the current situation of 20% of students having done 10% of the reading;</li>\n<li>what the decline of print culture \u201creally means\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have written <strong>a lot</strong> over the past 25 years about the collapse of form of content due to digitization. It feels weird to have written about it over the last 25 years and to then watch it happen, participate in it happening, and also see the results of the collapse of form not just in children and young people in general, but <em>in my own children</em>. </p>\n<p>So this is less of a new-thing-that-caught-my-attention and more of a oh, another thing I\u2019ll put in my confirmation bias bucket about how I feel good about an insightful observation.</p>\n<p>If you were born before, say, 1985, you were educated in and came of age in a thoroughly print/literate society. What Musgrave put clearly was this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At some point, I and many people my age must have been taught the difference between a book written by a single author and an edited volume; this is now knowledge I will be working into my lesson plans<sup id=\"fnref2:literate\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:literate\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and another example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Print literacy assumed and facilitated conversation; it also developed familiarity with the conventions of a literate society \u2014 that is, a society in which a dominant, even a predominant, stratum was aware, if sometimes only implicitly, of distinctions now lost, such as the difference between a tabloid and a broadsheet or between a pulp and a textbook. (In my recent experience, students no longer reliably process the pagination and layout of textbooks as helpful or as conveying hierarchies or cues about how to read them \u2014 rather, many struggle with how to navigate textbooks, as they have not often been exposed to them.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is simultaneously fascinating and to a degree, horrifying because of what I think is undeniably a collapse, just due to the speed in which the change has happened.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t really think about or understand what <em>literacy</em> meant in terms of common understanding in a society, or how <em>literacy</em> played a fundamental part of the societies in which I grew up. What I <em>thought</em> it meant, naively, was \u201cbeing able to read and understand things\u201d, but you can drive a truck through \u201cthings\u201d and \u201cunderstand\u201d. </p>\n<p>The key there is common understanding, or at least some degree of common understanding. I\u2019ve written before about somehow knowing the difference between a tabloid newspaper and a broadsheet newspaper, and that this isn\u2019t something you\u2019re explicitly taught in the way that you\u2019re sat down one day and your parents or educators teach you about editorial intent, business model, and how they interact with for historical reasons the size of paper on which news is printed. </p>\n<p>No, what this helped make clear was that (duh) we\u2019re shaped by a literate society, and after a while, the shaping of a literate society means that due to common understanding, we can take shortcuts. Shortcuts like \u201ca serif font is more trustworthy than a san serif font\u201d. You are the fish that\u2019s swimming in water, doesn\u2019t know what water is, and unless you pay a lot of attention, you might not notice what literacy is doing to, or for, you. </p>\n<p>But if you\u2019ve been reading this for a while, then you\u2019ll know where I\u2019m going here. </p>\n<p>Digitization is the ultimate collapse of form. For reasons of economics (i.e. storage and processing capacity), taking information and reducing it into a form that can be stored, manipulated, and retransmitted by computers involved breaking that information down to, well, its Shannon bones<sup id=\"fnref:shannon\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:shannon\">3</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>It is, like they say, just ones and zeros at the end of it. That would get you started.</p>\n<p>Musgrave points out that a literate society discovered, created, and then built itself around a whole bunch of affordances that could rely on a shared experience: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>students no longer reliably process the pagination and layout of textbooks as helpful or as conveying hierarchies or cues about how to read them \u2014 rather, many struggle with how to navigate textbooks, as they have not often been exposed to them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now this isn\u2019t to say that print design practices to show information hierarchy are sort of inherently baked into our brains, a sort of Chomsky-esque hierachy-detection-device. But it is to say that a bunch of emergent standards, well, emerged to create shortcuts, like I mentioned above.</p>\n<p>There are distinctions that exist in knowledge that I think were reflected in physical media, yes sometimes out of physical constraints, but also perhaps due to the underlying information and its structure itself. I imagine there are a bunch of library information science graduates reading this shaking their heads at my reckons here. </p>\n<p>Another example here is the story about <em>kids these days</em> not knowing what filesystems are and instead throwing everything into the Google Drive blender and just searching for things. That <em>works</em>, yes, but is it helpful in terms of organization? Could more explicit organization -- folders! anything else! -- be more helpful in helping keep track of information and keep track of understanding? This isn\u2019t me just doing a <em>god I wish kids these days would use folders</em>, it\u2019s as much a reflection on Google\u2019s <em>opinion</em> that may have been a result of business strategy that <em>search</em> is the best way to do things, and it just so happens that search (or, rather advertising based on search intent) is Google\u2019s bread and butter. </p>\n<p>There is a whole part here where cognitive psychologists might chime in about how we think and the structure of our brains makes us predisposed to, what, understand? certain types of information certain forms more easily, whether you want to go into the (discredited?) theory of learning styles or not. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve written before about how the feed collapsed the distinctions between the <em>kind</em> of media that people grew up with, a sort of unintentional confusion. </p>\n<p>Facebook was one example of this when links and content were introduced into the feed -- by design, the information in a feed was more or less undifferentiated. Make the feed easy to use. Make it clean. Make Facebook the important thing, not the information coming from external sources. </p>\n<p>This was also technically easy, of course. It would be more difficult to present, say, the NY Times differently than the NY Post in someone\u2019s feed, unless you were rendering say the information as an image (of which! more storage! more expensive!)</p>\n<p>Change is happening from two positions, here: those who grew up with shortcuts lost them and had to adapt. The shortcuts you\u2019re used to from a lifetime of a literate society and the forms and frames of such a society have been blown away, creating the opportunity for in some respects disguise and trickery. Too expensive for you to create a physical broadsheet newspaper? Well with internet publishing you can <em>look</em> like a broadsheet newspaper now.  </p>\n<p>Then from the other end, the creation of new forms, new shortcuts, new affordances at breakneck speed, to which Musgrave alludes to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is specifically that assignments and examinations that functioned well within the span of a few years are no longer feasible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>by which I interpret to mean that assignments and examinations created within and assuming knowledge of the common understanding affordances of a literate society could no longer rely on that common knowledge and understanding. You can imagine in this way the combination of cheap mobile computing and connectivity a sort of cultural K-T extinction event that within a decade had eaten away at or wiped out a whole method of understanding in replace of a new one, and a new one that was under economic pressure to win, as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>My position is that we\u2019ve undoubtedly lost something. Whether what\u2019s replacing/outcompeting that literate society is <em>better</em> or not is I think still out for the jury. It\u2019s certainly different, and the literate institutions -- those institutions that were created within and designed to assume that literate common understanding -- are clearly not capable of adapting quickly enough. </p>\n<p>This is to say nothing of the effects of generative AI. If you are going to say \u201cwell, generative AI lets us do what we could do with Photoshop for years anyway\u201d then you are wrong and you need to learn why<sup id=\"fnref:why\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:why\">4</a></sup>. It is now easier than it ever was to make a thing <em>look</em> (or sound, or read, or so on) like another thing. Style transfer itself is already more than, what, five years old? When I say \u201ceasier than it ever was\u201d, that undersells it: it is now trivial and ultimately accessible to anyone who wants to.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? It means another perspective to look at digital natives for one, a concept that I think is easily (and sometimes willfully) misunderstood. We could now look at digital natives as those who have grown up predominantly with digital forms of content (whatever they are), and on aggregate lack the common understanding of physical literate forms (like Musgrage\u2019s example, the fact that \u201cjournals\u201d exist with issues an volumes).</p>\n<p>But one attribute of those digital natives is that they understand that forms are malleable. In fact, forms may not be trustable <em>at all</em> seeing as exactly how malleable they are in the first place. I (and others) make jokes about the Star Trek episode where the Enterprise encounters tamarians, who speak only in metaphor<sup id=\"fnref:darmok\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:darmok\">5</a></sup> (\u201cShaka, when the walls fell\u201d, \u201cTemba, his arms wide!\u201d, Darmak and Jalad at Tanagra\u201d), and their parallels to memes and image macros, the rapid spread of shared understanding, a sort of gestalt around the combination of an image from popular culture (or an image <em>of</em> popular culture) and corresponding text. </p>\n<p>Are image memes rich in meaning? I\u2019d say so. Are they like poems? No, they\u2019re different. But do they share common intent to convey feeling? I think so. </p>\n<p>But now we have, at speed, a sort of shattered Babel of shared understanding that also stems from a shattering and re-forming of form. </p>\n<p>Again, another example: <em>what is a podcast</em>? What is the form of a podcast? Is it a piece of audio, accessible by an RSS feed? Is it two or more people discussing something? Is it two or more people discussing something on video? is it two or more people discussing something on video that can only be accessed on Spotify and not in a podcast app? Is it something that can only be played back through a Podcast app? Is it audio visual content that can be accessed on Netflix, and Netflix only, but still retains. conversational format? Is it allowed to include editing? Is it allowed to include indoor locations as well as outdoor locations? </p>\n<p>And then what does it mean if some content comes from a podcast? Does that mean it was cheap to produce? Does that mean it was produce independently? What does it mean to be produced independently? When I say I learned or heard of something from a podcast, how trustable do you think that information is? Do you need to know who hosted it? Could you guess at how trustable or accurate the information was from just the name alone and the fact that I listened to a podcast? </p>\n<p>That\u2019s to say nothing of the branding of form, either. What\u2019s a newsletter? What is a Substack? One intent of branding is to create an emotional connection and to set some sort of definition and expectation. How is a Substack [sic] different from a newsletter, and if I tell you I read something from a Substack as opposed to a newsletter, what does that mean to you?</p>\n<p>Did you know that a <em>tumblr</em> is a form? That a <em>gif</em> means something different than a meme? What does a TikTok versus a Reel versus a Story mean?</p>\n<p>All of these are malleable forms that have been <em>designed</em>. Their constraints are different that literate media, but constraints exist nonetheless. Portrait versus vertical formats still exist. Pixel density exists, or used to exist. Website versus app exists, hell, the platform upon which a form exists makes a difference, whether from the OS level through to whether Netflix or Spotify or Facebook or Libby or Kindle is a platform.</p>\n<p>It used to be that I could tell, physically, if I were need the end of a novel. There would be fewer pages left. It used to be that I could tell if I were near the end of an ebook because my percentage read indicator (not! the page number, another loss of shared reference point, replaced by, what, \u201clocation\u201d) would be at what, 98%. But now 98% doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m near the end. Now 85% might mean I\u2019m near the end because the cheapness of storage and transmission means that it\u2019s trivial from a technical \u201cpublishing\u201d point of view for a publisher to include a few thousand words of teaser for the next novel in the series. So now I\u2019m not nearly finished of the book, of the ebook, but I\u2019m nearly finished of the story that I paid for, that\u2019s encapsulated in a digital file that still mimics due to affordances and expectations the holdover of people who grew up with and understand books.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some drama that caught my attention, I swear it\u2019s related. The other day, some guy with a big Twitter account complained that on Bluesky, he was getting way less \u201cengagement\u201d than the equivalent post on X. He bemoaned that if Bluesky\u2019s intent was to become the next global townsquare then it was failing, and it would never achieve its goal. So like I\u2019ve done before, I blithely posted that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Global townsquares considered harmful at this stage of humanity\u2019s development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which is another way of rehashing the context collapse argument and conversation, which is another way of pointing out that \u201cwe\u201d lack shared understanding to the extent that platforms big enough (e.g. the EU\u2019s Very Large Online Platforms, those with over 45 million users in the EU) do not have users with enough shared understanding to not, essentially, get in big fucking fights the entire time, short of genuinely world-spanning events like, I don\u2019t know <em>football</em> or the Olympics and even then, not really.  </p>\n<p>Tom Carden then helpfully pointed me towards Herbert Dreyfus\u2019s book On The Internet<sup id=\"fnref:dreyfus\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:dreyfus\">6</a></sup>, of which he helpfully quoted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the vision of a worldwide electronic agora precisely misses the Kierkegaardian point that the people talking to each other in the Athenian agora were members of a direct democracy who were directly affected by the issues they were discussing, and, most importantly, the point of the discussion was for them to take the responsibility and risk of voting publicly on the questions they were debating. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Kierkegaard, a worldwide electronic agora is an oxymoron. The Athenian agora is precisely the opposite of the public sphere, where anonymous electronic kibitzers from all over the world, who risk nothing, come together to announce and defend their opinions. As an extension to the deracinated public sphere, the electronic agora is a grave danger to real political community. Kierkegaard enables us to see that the problem is not that Rheingold's 'electronic agora' is too utopian; it is not an agora at all, but a nowhere place for anonymous nowhere people. As such, it is dangerously distopian.\u201d<sup id=\"fnref2:dreyfus\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:dreyfus\">6</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s a long paragraph. I believe in you, you can finish it.</p>\n<p>What Dreyfus is getting across is one aspect of our so-called global town squares or agoras, that they fundamentally lack a sense of accountability. It is different if you turn up to a town square and nobody knows who you are. (You could make an argument, I suppose, that <em>doxxing</em> is a backlash or some sort of attempt to actually get to an agora by instituting accountability to one\u2019s words, but then that doxxing is invariably used towards a purpose of, well, mob justice)</p>\n<p>But the Athenian agoras weren\u2019t just about accountability, they were about taking <em>the responsibility and risk of voting publicly on the questions they were debating</em>. What shared questions are being debated? The colour of the dress? Is this entertaining? Sure. Helpful? I mean to the extent that it\u2019s a lesson into the variability of the human experience and how what we perceive isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there, the science lesson that colours don\u2019t really exist? (Which I imagine can be felt like a universe-ending existential threat calling everything you hold dear into question).</p>\n<p>\u201cSmaller\u201d groups of people, sure. Groups that coalesce around forms, sure. At least Star Trek fans have previous series  to coalesce around when they decide to be the best at hating the newest iteration of the franchise. </p>\n<p>So I\u2019m not worried in the sense that forms are being destroyed and new ones are being created. Creating the new ones is exciting! That we\u2019re creating the new ones without potentially applying what we\u2019ve learned before is disappointing but not surprising. What I am worried about is the difference between the two, the phase change between what was and what is now, and then what will come after. Computing I think means there\u2019s nothing stopping malleability of form. Someone posted the other day a portable Sony video editing rig that looked like exactly the kind of thing that you\u2019d use for a couple of decades during the heyday of electronic newsgathering. I don\u2019t know, miniDV ingest on one end, some quick editing on the rig before squirting the DV files elsewhere for broadcast. Now it\u2019s Capcut on a phone, or Da Vinci for a video essay. (What <em>is</em> a video essay?) Or whatever\u2019s used to create MasterClass videos, or Veritasium videos, or what have you.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s a world where there\u2019s less and less shared understanding? I don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s less shared understanding, to be honest, versus rapidly reconfiguring shared understanding that surfaces and then drowns to be remade again, form and content both. </p>\n<p>All I know is that when my kids found out about what a phone directory was, and why it existed in the time of a lack of search, they thought it made sense as was a pretty good idea. So there\u2019s that, at least.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>OVER THREE THOUSAND WORDS THIS TIME. I don\u2019t know about you, but four times looks like a trend. I shall try to subvert it next time.</p>\n<p>How have you been?</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Dan</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Let\u2019s get you shipping</h2>\n<p>Aside from my <a href=\"https://www.verylittlegravitas.com\" target=\"_blank\">regular consulting</a>, I also do <a href=\"https://www.verylittlegravitas.com/how-people-work\" target=\"_blank\">team workshops</a> and individual <a href=\"https://www.verylittlegravitas.com/how-people-work/coaching\" target=\"_blank\">coaching</a> based on the workshop curriculum.

He\u2019s often depicted with an eye patch or an empty socket. But what happened to poor old Odin\u2019s eye? In his obsessive hunt for wisdom, he discovered Mimir\u2019s Well, a sacred spring rumored to hold infinite knowledge. But it came at a terrible price. <a href=\"https://www.voluspa.org/voluspa26-30.htm\">Odin gouged out his own eye</a>, ripped it clean out of his skull, and tossed it into the well for a single drink. With that sip, infinite knowledge flooded into him. He traded partial blindness for a different form of perception. But even with all this knowledge, Odin was the god of war, frenzy and madness.</p><p>In 1942, Jorge Luis Borges told the story of \u201c<a href=\"https://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf\">Funes The Memorious</a>,\u201d who, after a horseback riding accident, gained perfect, total, infinite memory. But what seemed like a gift quickly became a curse. Infinite information utterly overwhelmed him. He couldn\u2019t think, speak or live normally. The infinite didn\u2019t expand his world. It crushed him.</p><p>In 1964, X-Men introduced <a href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Cerebro\">Cerebro</a>, a supercomputer that connects the mind of the user to every single mutant on Earth all at once. But this is lethal to the untrained mind. It instantly invites infinite noise directly into the user\u2019s brain, causing extreme psychic overload, even coma or death.</p><p>In every myth, the lesson is the same: <em>The path to the infinite is the path to madness.</em></p><p>And yet, we still gouge out our eyes. We plug our untrained minds into the infinite machines \u2013 our smartphones, our social media, our Oura rings, our prediction markets, and our AIs. And as a result, we are going mad.</p><h3><strong>02.</strong></h3><h3><strong>THE MIND THAT ENTERS LIMITLESS TERRAIN WITH LIMITED CAPACITY INVITES DEFEAT</strong></h3><p>William James, one of the fathers of psychology, once <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57628/57628-h/57628-h.htm\">wrote</a>,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cAttention is the taking possession by the mind.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>So what, exactly, are we allowing to take possession of <em>our</em> minds?</p><p>We are not built for the infinite. The human brain is powerful, but <em>finite</em>. And our attentional capacity is a limited resource. Nelson Cowan, a leading researcher on working memory, tells us the Magic Number is <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11515286/\">4\u00b11</a>. Meaning, we can only focus our attention on three to five meaningful chunks of information before our cognitive capacity overflows. Now, how does that compare to the number of tabs you have open right now? The number of TikToks you\u2019ve scrolled today? The number of unread emails sitting in your inbox?</p><p>When we exceed the Magic Number, we risk <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39278166/\">ego depletion</a>. When our cognitive load becomes too high, our self-control depletes. We become a soft target \u2013 more impulsive, more predisposed to reach for short-term gratification, distractions, rage bait, junk food, gambling and buying more things we don\u2019t actually need.</p><p>But what about paying constant attention to the things that <em>really</em> matter? Global crises, suffering, injustice? Isn\u2019t it our duty to care for our brethren?</p><p>Noble, yes, but there\u2019s a paradox here. The more suffering we try to <em>absorb</em>, the less we\u2019re able to <em>act</em>. This is called <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/7/19/15925506/psychic-numbing-paul-slovic-apathy\">psychic numbing</a>. Compassion fatigue. It\u2019s a defense mechanism where empathy and the ability to respond collapses as the scale of tragedy increases. The mind can\u2019t metabolize the infinite, so it shuts down. This is why a single person\u2019s story can sometimes move millions more effectively than statistics of mass suffering. Even Mother Teresa, the saint herself, has <a href=\"https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/journal/7303a/jdm7303a.htm\">said</a>,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cIf I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t care, but because the infinite exceeds the limits of human capacity.</p><h3><strong>03.</strong></h3><h3><strong>THE FIELD OF ATTENTION IS THE FIELD OF REALITY</strong></h3><p>Our attention deserves protection, because our attention is our reality.</p><p>Remember the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo\">Invisible Gorilla Test</a>? People watch a video of players passing a basketball and are told to count the passes. While they\u2019re focused on counting, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the scene. Afterward, when asked, \u201cDid you catch the gorilla?\u201d most people never noticed it. The test reveals how easily our visual field and perception fail based on how and where we pay attention.</p><p>Attention is our field of view \u2013 the small slice of the world that our mind chooses to look at.</p><p>That field of view becomes our reality tunnel \u2013 a narrow corridor carved by what holds our focus, shaping what we notice and, equally, what we miss. That reality tunnel becomes our perceived reality \u2013 the world we believe we\u2019re in, simply because it\u2019s the only world we\u2019re seeing. And our perceived reality becomes our lived action \u2013 it dictates how we move, what we choose, who we become.</p><p>We must strategically protect and take aim with our attention, not just because it\u2019s the lens through which we see, but because it\u2019s the architecture of our reality.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3R-1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58a306a-17a7-48d4-aefc-8640d7a7b94e_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3R-1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58a306a-17a7-48d4-aefc-8640d7a7b94e_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>04.</strong></h3><h3><strong>KNOW THY ENEMY: A 24/7 CULTURE WITHOUT REST</strong></h3><p>How did we even get here? How did we begin to desire and attempt to pay attention to the infinite, which consistently defeats us?</p><p>Much of the current discourse would blame our collapse of attention, and with it, shared reality, on modern technologies \u2013 smartphones, social media, algorithms, AI. But the attention war began <em>long</em> before any of that.</p><p>Art critic Jonathan Crary\u2019s book <em><a href=\"https://xenopraxis.net/readings/crary_247.pdf\">24/7</a></em> explores how we entered a culture that battles against rest and time itself. A nonstop 24/7 culture that never turns off. If attention is finite, a 24/7 society fights to expand the surface area of waking time to capture more of it.</p><p>Reed Hastings has famously stated that Netflix\u2019s main competition isn\u2019t other media or entertainment companies.<em> <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition\">It\u2019s sleep</a>.</em></p><p>This acceleration really took off with cable news and the birth of CNN in 1980. TV news and programming stopped ending with nightly sign-offs. It stopped syncing with the rhythms of our sleep cycles. Media became an <em>infinite</em> loop of endless, real-time information.</p><p>There have been even stranger attempts to literally extend our daylight. In 1993, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-russian-space-mirror-briefly-lit-night-180957894/\">Russia\u2019s Znamya project</a> sent mirrored satellites into orbit to try to reflect sunlight back onto Earth to increase the time and attention available for productivity.</p><p>Our culture tempts us to strive for an aspirational identity rooted in infinite information and the illusion of potential mastery over it.</p><p>But there is no endpoint, only an ever-growing stream of content. We face a nonstop 24/7 loop of madness.</p><h3><strong>05.</strong></h3><h3><strong>THAT WHICH SEEKS ATTENTION CANNOT BE DEFEATED BY GIVING IT ATTENTION</strong></h3><p>Information expands to fill the space available, and in our 24/7 culture and modern media environment, the space available is infinite. This means there are now more news stories than there is actual news. W. David Marx calls this the <a href=\"https://culture.ghost.io/only-fads-a-culture-and-economy-of-labubu/\">Parkinson\u2019s Law of Media</a>.</p><p>Marx argues that ad-driven platforms financially incentivize all media \u2013 and at this point, nearly every company and person <em>is</em> media \u2013 to endlessly react and reproduce more media on anything that trends. The tiniest spark of a story can quickly explode into what feels like a full-blown cultural atomic bomb.</p><p>Further, Marx explains that the aspirational identity around media literacy has drifted toward a belief that we must remain fluent in every single thing online \u2013 high culture, low culture, things we love, things we hate. This traps us in an endless chase to consume <em>every. single. narrative.</em></p><p>But by the time we\u2019re arguing about whether something is real or fake, good or bad, important or meaningless, the battle is already lost. The attention war itself won, and we are the spoils.</p><p>Personalities, products, and subcultures win simply by demanding attention, even from their haters. This creates a hyperstitious loop. Debate and critique disproportionately amplify the very thing we hope to squash, pushing it further into existence and significance through repetition.</p><p>In <em>The Art of Wa</em>r, Sun Tzu wrote,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cDo not swallow bait offered by the enemy.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://nicksusi.substack.com/p/magic-online\">We cannot defeat that which seeks attention by any means necessary by giving it attention.</a> This is the paradox at the heart of the attention war.</p><h3><strong>06.</strong></h3><h3><strong>THE DIGITAL REALM APPEARS INFINITE TO THE EYE BUT IS FINITE IN DEPTH</strong></h3><p>Modern technology makes it feel like we possess infinite knowledge at our fingertips. But that\u2019s not true.</p><p>Our online environments only <em>appear</em> infinite. The deepest, most nuanced knowledge still lives beyond any device. Everything we see through search, social media, or AI is limited to what has already been indexed, posted or trained. For example, Google may index hundreds of billions of web pages, yet that still accounts for <a href=\"https://neoncentury.com/why-cant-search-engines-access-the-deep-web/\">&lt;5%</a> of the internet. The rest sits in the <em>deep web</em> \u2013 private information, profiles, messages and spaces locked behind passwords, paywalls and encryption \u2013 <em>unreachable</em>. Also consider all knowledge that\u2019s never been coded, or cannot be coded by a machine.</p><p>So both things are true at once: the internet is both too large for any one person to fully grasp in their lifetime, and yet that internet is still nowhere close to a true reflection of all our human knowledge.</p><p>To be clear, this doesn\u2019t mean these technological gateways <em>aren\u2019t</em> extraordinary. They expand our minds in ways no past generation could ever have imagined. But reality can\u2019t be fully understood without curiously wandering beyond a feed and paying attention to the physical world, to people, places and knowledge <em>uncaptured</em> by the internet.</p><p>Randonautica is a viral app with a cult-like following that launched in 2020 (h/t <a href=\"https://zine.kleinkleinklein.com/p/friction\">Ruby Justice Thelot</a>). Users set an intention, and the app generates random nearby coordinates for them to explore in the physical world. The idea is to alter one\u2019s reality by breaking out of their <em>existing</em> reality tunnel and pushing them into unexpected experiences. The app became infamous after some people stumbled into unsettling situations, including one case in Seattle where <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/life/how-does-randonautica-work-the-creepy-tiktok-famous-app-can-help-you-realize-intentions-27624516\">teens found human remains</a> near a Randonautica location.</p><p>But does the app actually <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaemanuel/randonautica-freaky-coincidences\">alter reality</a>? Or is it that once users set an intention, enter a new environment, and tune their attention, they simply notice <em>different</em> patterns and assign <em>new</em> meaning to what was always there? Much like the gorilla and basketballs, what we notice depends on what we\u2019re primed to see. \u201cTouch grass\u201d isn\u2019t just a cute meme. It\u2019s a reminder to break the 24/7 infinite loop and widen our aperture of attention so our field of reality expands.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B7We!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2faf0e0c-d4c4-4d19-8571-dfb5f5a61906_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B7We!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2faf0e0c-d4c4-4d19-8571-dfb5f5a61906_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>07.</strong></h3><h3><strong>TO MISTAKE THE STAGE FOR THE WORLD IS BE TO CONQUERED</strong></h3><p>Even within the limited reflection of the physical world that we see online, there\u2019s no guarantee that any of it is <em>real</em>. As Sun Tzu says,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cAll warfare is based on deception.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>The idea that people perform for each other isn\u2019t new. In 1956, half a century before the launch of Facebook, sociologist Erving Goffman pioneered the <a href=\"https://monoskop.org/images/1/19/Goffman_Erving_The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life.pdf\">dramaturgical approach</a> to viewing social life as theater. He viewed each of us as actors, playing roles on a public front stage to shape how others perceive us, and then retreating to the backstage of our private lives. In our current social media era, we\u2019re more aware than ever that <em>everyone</em> is performing. Yet this awareness doesn\u2019t seem to make us any less <em>susceptible</em> to staged performance, or curbs us for performing <em>ourselves</em>. Even authenticity is now a performance and manufactured aesthetic.</p><p>Much of the current discourse is <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@megameme__/video/7576771220264258830\">panic</a> about reality collapsing every time a photorealistic image generated by Nano Banana goes viral. But the challenge of discerning what\u2019s real online has existed for far longer than debates about generative AI or the authenticity of images.</p><p>Even those who preach media literacy and cultural fluency still fall for these traps. They believe information is staged when it isn\u2019t, like the claim that <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@himollysl/video/7322612091490176302\">HBO engineered</a> \u201cthe mob-wife aesthetic\u201d trend as a psyop for the 25th anniversary of <em>The Sopranos</em>. They in fact <em><a href=\"https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2024/01/26/hbo-max-mob-wife-aesthetic-marketing-strategy\">did not</a></em>. And they believe information is real that is actually staged, like <a href=\"https://itscharlibb.substack.com/p/the-realities-of-being-a-pop-star\">Charli XCX joining Substack</a> to journal about the realities of being a pop star, which in reality is a professional entertainer being paid to strategically use the aesthetics of raw confessionals as an ad for both the platform and her upcoming album.</p><p>None of this would matter if we treated the online as an entertainment stage, a series of magic tricks, a <em>dreamworld</em>. Charli herself acknowledges the fun in blurring the lines between truth and performance. But reality becomes strange when we continuously mistake performance for truth and pass it around as insightful cultural signal. Much of today\u2019s commentary now looks less like real cultural analysis and more like white collar fan fiction and conspiracy theories about what\u2019s happening \u201cbackstage.\u201d</p><p>At the end of the day, we\u2019re all putting on a front stage performance that\u2019s shaping real life decisions, but many are forgetting it\u2019s all just an act. As a result, even among people who claim to defend media literacy, we\u2019re losing our grip on what\u2019s real and what\u2019s a performance.</p><h3><strong>08.</strong></h3><h3><strong>REALITY IS NOT COLLAPSING, BUT CONSTANTLY RECOMPOSING</strong></h3><p>Our shared sense of reality is always shifting. It has always gone through cycles of breaking apart and coming back together in new forms.</p><p>Venkatesh Rao argues that we don\u2019t live in one \u201creal world,\u201d but in near infinite overlapping belief-worlds \u2013 different religions, fandoms, economic theories, political ideologies. The \u201creal world\u201d is simply the dozen or so belief-worlds that are <a href=\"https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/this-is-the-new-real-world\">most </a><em><a href=\"https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/this-is-the-new-real-world\">consequential</a></em> at a given moment. Only a few meaningful stories shape history, and even <em>those</em> rise and fall as collective belief changes. Power, wealth, popularity, or even truth don\u2019t guarantee that a world matters. Only <em>consequentiality</em> does. As Ana\u00efs Nin said,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cWe do not see the world as it is, but as we are.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>Rao gives the example of Galileo vs. the Catholic Church. In the 17th century, Galileo was right that the sun doesn\u2019t revolve around the Earth as the center of the universe, but the Church\u2019s constructed world was more dominant and <em>consequential</em> than his truth. Galileo\u2019s true world didn\u2019t become consequential until many centuries and technological developments later. It wasn\u2019t until about 350 years later in 1992 that the Vatican <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/world/after-350-years-vatican-says-galileo-was-right-it-moves.html\">formally acknowledged</a> the Catholic Church\u2019s error in condemning Galileo. <em>Oops.</em></p><p>So what we call the \u201creal world,\u201d our shared social reality, is really just a temporary construction which lasts only as long as enough people believe in it. Reality is in constant negotiations. When belief fades, that world dissolves and a new one forms. Today, for example, we can see the neoliberal world losing consequentiality, while the worlds of Trump, mysticism and the accelerating AI arms race rise.</p><p>Understanding reality isn\u2019t about infinitely chasing truth with our finite attention. It\u2019s about understanding <em>which</em> worlds are becoming more or less <em>consequential</em>.</p><p>Perhaps part of why we experience reality collapse is that 24/7 media and infinite access to information allow us see <em>more</em> of these worlds rising, falling, and recomposing. The churn was always happening. We just couldn\u2019t access it in real time... <em>until now.</em></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RQZy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24efd38f-e185-406c-b8fb-bf9c8b2dd546_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RQZy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24efd38f-e185-406c-b8fb-bf9c8b2dd546_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>09.</strong></h3><h3><strong>VICTORY BELONGS TO HE WHO KNOWS LIMITED ATTENTION IS NOT A WEAKNESS BUT A STRENGTH</strong></h3><p>Sun Tzu himself wrote,</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cIf he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><p>Even Sun Tzu understood that finite resources must be spent wisely. The same law governs the attention war. Survival isn\u2019t just about what you focus on. It\u2019s about what you deliberately <em>refuse</em> to focus on.</p><p><em>Restraint</em> is a winning strategy.</p><p>Limiting our attention is not a weakness. It\u2019s how we maintain mental fortitude.</p><p><em>Move on.</em></p><h3><strong>10.</strong></h3><h3><strong>MASTERY BEGINS WITH TRIAGING WHAT CAN BE CONTROLLED AND WHAT IS DISTRACTION</strong></h3><p>So how does a soldier navigate the battlefield of attention?</p><p>It begins with a system of triage.</p><p>Looking at the work of psychologist Julian Rotter, we must ask, what is in our <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-19211-001\">locus of </a><em><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-19211-001\">control</a></em>? I.e. What can I directly act on right now? What is in our locus of <em>influence</em>. I.e. What can I not control, but can affect over time? What is in our locus of <em>concern</em>? I.e. What are the things I deeply care about, but cannot meaningfully change? And what is in our zone to <em>ignore</em>? I.e. What is everything outside my knowledge and reach, which I must accept I don\u2019t and can\u2019t fully know?</p><p>In our current 24/7 culture and relationship with media, we\u2019ve become so disembodied from our physical surroundings. In a weightless state, it\u2019s become much harder to discern what is actually within our control or influence, our inner locus, and what\u2019s actually materially <em>consequential</em> to our lives.</p><p>Instead, so many of us get stuck endlessly in the outer locus of concern \u2013 the areas far outside our control or influence \u2013 expending scarce attention on things we dislike, can\u2019t meaningfully affect, or don\u2019t even need to have an opinion on. We form opinions about <em>everything</em>, unable to have an informed opinion about anything.</p><p><a href=\"https://summerofprotocols.com/artificial-memory-web\">Francis Bacon</a> warned that when we have no clear \u201cprenotion or perception of what we are seeking, we seek and toil and wander aimlessly, as if in infinite space. Whereas, if we have a particular prenotion, infinity is at once interrupted.\u201d When our attention narrows, we can move forward with purpose.</p><p>Nietzsche, in <em>On the Use and Abuse of History for Life</em>, argued that <a href=\"https://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEENietzscheAbuseTableAll.pdf\">active selective </a><em><a href=\"https://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEENietzscheAbuseTableAll.pdf\">forgetting</a></em> is essential for life itself. That without the ability to let go of the infinite, action becomes <em>impossible</em>. He warns that the infinite overwhelms the present and weakens vitality, and that every living being needs a limited horizon.</p><p>To be very clear, this is not about anti-technology or anti-ambition. It is pro-focus, pro-intention, and pro-discernment in how we understand broader historical contexts and apply the affordances of modern technology and media to our own ambitions. This is a call to reclaim our attention as a finite, precious resource.</p><h3><strong>11.</strong></h3><h3><strong>STRATEGIC FOCUS IS NOT STRATEGIC IGNORANCE</strong></h3><p>Now, to be clear, there is a dark side in shifting from the infinite to the finite.</p><p>We risk an overcorrection to an overcorrection. We can turn too far inward, toward isolation, narcissism, echo chambers, tribalism, xenophobia, and authoritarian nationalism. We\u2019re already feeling these worlds gaining consequentiality today.</p><p>But strategic <em>focus</em> is not the same as strategic <em>ignorance</em>. In <em>The Unknowers: How Strategic Ignorance Rules The World</em>, sociologist Linsey McGoey warns about <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Unknowers.html?id=-YJb0QEACAAJ\">ostrich instruction</a>, dissociating and claiming ignorance to absolve one\u2019s self of responsibility, like the myth of an ostrich burying its head in the sand.</p><p>The flood of infinite information leaves us overwhelmed, manipulated, and exhausted. <em>It\u2019s a lot.</em> Limiting what we take in defends us \u2013 <em>but</em> only if we retain self-awareness and humility of what we don\u2019t know, and stay curious and humble enough to learn from perspectives outside our immediate field of view. There is much that we don\u2019t know and can\u2019t affect.</p><p>This is permission to find comfort in knowing that we cannot, and will not, know or change <em>everything</em>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DsFv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd773e0c3-b69c-45c2-bcac-9031cc664aee_1280x107.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"107\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DsFv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd773e0c3-b69c-45c2-bcac-9031cc664aee_1280x107.png\" style=\"\" width=\"1280\"/><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Good luck out there, soldier.</p><p>As your eyes wander from here to the next patch of digital terrain, will you march forward with intention, tighten your grip on your attention, and ask yourself, why are you here?</p><p>Now, move out and on.</p>",
