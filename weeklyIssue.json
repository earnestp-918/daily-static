      "bodyText": "<p>On Wednesday, Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. During his speech, he had this to say about Greenland:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe never asked for anything and we never got anything. We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be frankly unstoppable. But I won't do that. Okay, now everyone's saying, \u2018Oh, good.\u2019 That's probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland where we already had it as a trustee, but respectfully returned it back to Denmark not long ago after we defeated the Germans, the Japanese, the Italians, and others in World War II.\u201d</p></blockquote><div class=\"native-video-embed\"></div><p>Read that again. Sit with it for a second.</p><p>The President of the United States just told a room full of world leaders and business executives that American military force would be \u201cfrankly unstoppable\u201d against European allies. And then he said he wouldn\u2019t do it. For now.</p><p>You won\u2019t find this in any diplomacy textbook. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://time.com/7355488/trump-davos-speech-takeaways-analysis/\">the language of a protection racket</a>.</p><p>So how did reporters cover it?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/21/nx-s1-5683078/trump-davos-speech-tariffs-greenland\">NPR</a> (original headline): \u201cTrump says \u2018I won\u2019t use force\u2019 to obtain Greenland in Davos speech\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-nation-secure-greenland-us-davos-speech/story?id=129417816\">ABC News</a>: \u201cTrump rules out using military force to acquire Greenland in Davos speech\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/trump-greenland-davos-force-denmark.html\">CNBC</a>: \u201cTrump calls for \u2018immediate negotiations\u2019 on Greenland, but rules out using force\u201d</p><div class=\"bluesky-wrap outer\" style=\"height: auto; display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"></div><p>If you only read those headlines, you\u2019d think the president made some kind of conciliatory gesture. A de-escalation, even. \u201cOh good, he\u2019s not going to invade Denmark. What a relief!\u201d The stock market certainly interpreted it that way, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/trump-greenland-davos-force-denmark.html\">rallying on the news</a> that the American president had taken military action against a NATO ally off the table.</p><div><hr/></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"></div><div><hr/></div><p>But that\u2019s not what happened in that room. Trump reminded everyone of his capacity for violence, made clear that resistance would be futile, and then offered them a chance to surrender peacefully. \u201cI won\u2019t use force\u201d is misdirection, and the coverage fell for it.</p><p>Think about what he actually said. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force.\u201d That \u201cunless\u201d is doing a lot of work. It\u2019s a conditional. It means: if you don\u2019t give me what I want, the \u201cexcessive strength\u201d option remains available. The reassurance that follows doesn\u2019t negate the threat. It completes it.</p><p>And there was another line in the speech that barely registered in most stories. Addressing the European leaders who have <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/trump-greenland-davos-2026-world-economic-forum/\">opposed his Greenland push</a>, Trump said: \u201cYou can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.\u201d</p><p><em>We will remember.</em></p><p>He\u2019s threatening countries that have been American allies for 80 years, on a global stage, and daring them to do something about it.</p><p>And just in case the implications weren\u2019t clear enough, Trump took a moment to <a href=\"https://www.forever-wars.com/beware-the-trump-wont-use-force-in-greenland-headlines/\">remind the audience</a> of what he\u2019d just done in Venezuela. \u201cWe\u2019re a great power, even greater than many thought. They found that out two weeks ago in Venezuela,\u201d he said. Telling European leaders to hand over territory while referencing your recent military actions in the Western Hemisphere is making an offer they\u2019d be wise not to refuse.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/livestory/trump-carney-davos-9.7054255\">CBC\u2019s coverage</a> was blunt about the nature of the speech, describing it as \u201cat times menacing and at times rambling.\u201d That\u2019s closer to accurate. But \u201cmenacing\u201d didn\u2019t make it into most American headlines.</p><p>This is what sanewashing looks like. You take a threat, you extract the denial, and you print the denial as if it were the news. \u201cTrump won\u2019t use force\u201d is technically a thing he said. But printing that without the \u201cunstoppable\u201d part, without the \u201cwe will remember\u201d part, without the Venezuela reference, doesn\u2019t just fail to inform readers. It actively misleads them about what happened in that room.</p><h4><strong>Trump called his shot</strong></h4><p>There\u2019s a moment in the Davos speech that deserves special attention. It\u2019s easy to miss if you\u2019re not looking for it, buried as it is in the middle of the threat-then-denial sequence. But it\u2019s the most revealing thing Trump said all day.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now everyone\u2019s saying, \u2018Oh, good.\u2019 That\u2019s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force.\u201d</p><p>He narrated the sanewashing as it was happening. In real time, from the podium, Trump described exactly how journalists would cover his remarks. He knew they\u2019d seize on the denial. He knew \u201cI won\u2019t use force\u201d would become the headline. He knew the threat would fade into background noise. And he said so, out loud, while the cameras were rolling.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spp_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81ae56c4-420e-406e-ac3f-063269f7ed57_1024x683.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spp_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81ae56c4-420e-406e-ac3f-063269f7ed57_1024x683.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1024\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">US President Donald Trump arrives for a bilateral meeting with Switzerland's President on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 21, 2026.

Trump was telling the room, and the reporters in it, that he understands how this game works. Make the threat vivid enough that everyone hears it, then give them a clean quote they can print without feeling like they\u2019re taking sides. The threat does its job. The denial provides cover. Everyone gets what they need.</p><p>The coverage, almost universally, followed the script he laid out for them.</p><p>I\u2019ve been <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/185530/media-criticism-trump-sanewashing-problem\">writing about sanewashing</a> for a couple of years now. The term describes what happens when journalists take incoherent, threatening, or unhinged statements and repackage them into the conventional language of political reporting. It\u2019s how \u201cthey\u2019re eating the dogs\u201d becomes \u201cTrump raises concerns about immigration.\u201d It\u2019s how an hour of rambling about sharks and Hannibal Lecter becomes \u201cTrump holds rally in Las Vegas.\u201d</p><p>But this is something slightly different. Trump isn\u2019t just benefiting from sanewashing; he\u2019s anticipating it. He\u2019s building it into the structure of his rhetoric. The denial isn\u2019t a softening of the threat; it\u2019s the delivery mechanism that ensures the threat travels through mainstream news coverage without being flagged as dangerous.</p><p>Consider the irony: Trump delivered a line that explicitly mocked the predictability of media coverage, and then media coverage proved him right. He told them they\u2019d say \u201cOh, good,\u201d and they said \u201cOh, good.\u201d He might as well have written the headlines himself.</p><p>It suggests something a lot of reporters don\u2019t want to confront. Trump, for all his incoherence on other subjects, has a sophisticated understanding of how political journalism works. He knows the conventions. He knows that reporters want clean quotes. He knows that editors want headlines that don\u2019t sound editorialized. He knows that \u201cTrump threatens force\u201d will get flagged by cautious copy desks, while \u201cTrump says he won\u2019t use force\u201d sails through. So he gives them both, in the same breath, and lets the machinery of neutral-tone journalism do the rest.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/now-everyones-saying-oh-good?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4><strong>The weeks before Davos</strong></h4><p>To understand what Trump was really doing in that speech, you have to look at what came before it. The Davos address didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. It was the culmination of weeks of escalating threats, each one a little more explicit than the last.</p><p>Earlier this month, at a White House event ostensibly about oil companies and Venezuela, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/us-action-greenland-whether-like-it-or-not-denmark-rcna253234\">offered this</a> regarding Greenland: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not, because if we don\u2019t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland. That\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do if we don\u2019t. So we\u2019re going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult way.\u201d</p><p>Soon after, he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/10/politics/us-will-take-greenland-the-hard-way-if-it-cant-do-it-the-easy-way-trump-says\">sharpened the language</a>: \u201cI would like to make a deal the easy way, but if we don\u2019t do it the easy way, we\u2019re going to do it the hard way.\u201d</p><p>The easy way or the hard way. We heard the same phrase from Trump\u2019s own FCC chair, Brendan Carr, back in September. When the administration <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-kimmel-suspension-shows-how-fake\">went after late-night host Jimmy Kimmel</a>, Carr appeared on a far-right podcast and mentioned his agency\u2019s role in granting broadcast licenses. \u201cWhen we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,\u201d he said. Even Ted Cruz <a href=\"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fcc-kimmel-ted-cruz-first-amendment-rcna232900\">described the remark</a> as similar to the language of organized crime.</p><p>So when Trump stood at Davos and said he \u201cwon\u2019t use force,\u201d he was saying it after weeks of promising to do things \u201cthe hard way\u201d if necessary. The denial was arriving long after the threat had been delivered, repeated, and amplified.</p><p>And the threats weren\u2019t just rhetorical. In the days before Davos, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-pauses-greenland-tariffs-rcna255270\">announced new tariffs</a> on eight European countries specifically because they had opposed his Greenland demands. Economic punishment was already underway. The squeeze had begun. By the time Trump told the Davos audience that America would be \u201cunstoppable\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t use force, the coercion was already in motion through other channels.</p><p>This is how the shakedown works. You don\u2019t walk into someone\u2019s business and immediately start breaking things. You send signals first. You make clear that you\u2019re willing to cause pain. You demonstrate, through smaller acts of aggression, that you\u2019re serious. Then, when you finally sit down to \u201cnegotiate,\u201d the violence is already implied. You can afford to sound reasonable because everyone in the room knows what happens if they say no.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7mev35x2lo\">told the Norwegian prime minister</a> in a message that the world would not be safe until America had \u201cComplete and Total Control of Greenland.\u201d He reposted content on social media casting the UN and NATO as the \u201creal threat\u201d to the United States, rather than China and Russia. He threatened tariffs. He invoked Venezuela. He promised to do things \u201cwhether they like it or not.\u201d</p><p>Then he went to Davos and offered to negotiate.</p><p>Headlines treated this as a pivot toward diplomacy. But diplomacy requires good faith, and there was no good faith here. There was pressure, escalation, and then a momentary softening of tone designed to look like an off-ramp. European leaders in that room understood this. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-tells-davos-shift-towards-world-without-rules-2026-01-20/\">Emmanuel Macron</a> spoke the day before about a shift toward \u201ca world without rules,\u201d where \u201cinternational law is trampled underfoot and where the only laws it seems to matter is that of the strongest.\u201d He said, \u201cWe do prefer respect to bullies.\u201d</p><p>Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/trump-tells-europe-and-nato-to-hand-over-greenland-or-else\">responding to the speech</a>, said it was \u201cpositive\u201d that Trump ruled out military force but added that \u201cthe challenge is still there\u201d because \u201cthe president\u2019s ambition is intact.\u201d A foreign minister from a NATO ally was publicly expressing relief that the American president said he wouldn\u2019t invade, while noting that the threat of annexation remains. This is where we are.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, in his own Davos speech, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-carney-speech-davos-rules-based-order-9.7053350\">laid it out plainly</a>: \u201cWe are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.\u201d Trump\u2019s response, later in his own address, was to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5699148-trump-carney-canada-greenland/\">turn to Carney\u2019s remarks directly</a>: \u201cCanada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, when you make your statements.\u201d</p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-1HYKv6jusgI\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p>Same language, same strategy. Reporters keep covering each incident as if it\u2019s a one-off, an aberration, a moment of Trumpian excess that will soon give way to normal diplomacy. Meanwhile, the approach just keeps repeating.</p><h4><strong>A specific kind of language</strong></h4><p>The Davos speech would be alarming enough on its own. But it becomes something else entirely when you recognize it as part of a rhetorical style that stretches back years. Trump has been talking this way since he entered political life. Journalists keep treating each instance as a novelty, a gaffe, a moment of Trump being Trump. What they\u2019re missing is the consistency of the technique.</p><p>Trump talks like a mob boss.</p><p>I\u2019m describing a specific rhetorical style, one that has been analyzed by linguists, prosecutors, and organized crime experts. It has identifiable features: indirect speech acts, conditional threats, coded language, and plausible deniability built into the structure of the communication itself. The speaker makes the threat clear to the intended target while leaving themselves room to claim, if pressed, that they never actually said what everyone understood them to mean.</p><p>Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney and fixer, explained this during his 2019 congressional testimony: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give orders. He speaks in code. And I understand that code.\u201d</p><p>James Gagliano, a former member of the FBI\u2019s organized crime squad, <a href=\"https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/how-trump-speaks-mob-boss/\">said on Twitter</a> that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t begin to number\u201d the cooperating witnesses who described orders from mob bosses using similar language. The phrasing Cohen used to describe Trump\u2019s communication style was, to Gagliano, immediately recognizable from his years investigating the Mafia.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/28/how-trump-speaks-like-mob-boss/\">As Henry Farrell wrote in The Washington Post</a>, there\u2019s a reason mob bosses prefer ambiguous language: it makes it harder to prove charges against them. If you say \u201ckill him,\u201d that\u2019s evidence. If you say \u201ctake care of the problem,\u201d you\u2019ve communicated the same instruction while maintaining the ability to claim you meant something else. The structure protects the speaker.</p><p>Trump learned this dialect early. His mentor for years was Roy Cohn, the infamous attorney who <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/09/trump-mafia-behavior-analogy-ukraine-transcript.html\">represented major mob figures</a>. The late Selwyn Raab, a New York Times reporter who covered organized crime for decades, described Cohn\u2019s essential lesson: \u201cAlways be aggressive, take no prisoners.\u201d Trump absorbed that in the New York construction world of the 1980s, an industry thoroughly entangled with organized crime. He built his business in an environment where the coded language of threat and implication was simply how deals got done. And when he moved into politics, he brought that vocabulary with him.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_xcK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2713c8a8-1f0b-4a9a-9c81-0e2f0d5da48c_1024x675.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_xcK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2713c8a8-1f0b-4a9a-9c81-0e2f0d5da48c_1024x675.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1024\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Donald Trump (L), in 1984.

The favor was investigating Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s likely opponent in the 2020 election. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/23/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid-call/index.html\">Trump had frozen nearly $400 million in military aid</a> to Ukraine roughly a week before the call. The transaction was right there on the page.</p><p>Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/politics/quid-pro-quo-trump-ukraine-call\">called it</a> \u201ca classic Mafia-like shakedown.\u201d But a substantial portion of the coverage focused on the absence of an explicit quid pro quo statement. Because Trump didn\u2019t say \u201cif you don\u2019t investigate Biden, you won\u2019t get the missiles,\u201d many outlets treated the extortion as ambiguous. This is the sanewashing trap: demanding literal confession while ignoring structural coercion.</p><p><strong>January 2021: \u201cI just want to find 11,780 votes\u201d</strong></p><p>The call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html\">recorded and released by The Washington Post</a>, was Trump at his most explicit. The election was over. Biden had won Georgia by 11,779 votes. The results had been certified. And Trump called up the state\u2019s top election official to demand that he manufacture a different outcome.</p><p>\u201cAll I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\u201d</p><p>As legal analysts pointed out, Trump wasn\u2019t asking Raffensperger to investigate fraud. He was asking him to produce a specific number of votes that didn\u2019t exist. The word \u201cfind\u201d suggests creation, not discovery.</p><p>But it was the threat that followed that made the call unmistakable. Trump told Raffensperger that failing to act would be \u201ca big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer.\u201d He <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-raffensperger-georgia-call-transcript.html\">explicitly suggested</a> that Raffensperger could face prosecution for not going along: \u201cThat\u2019s a criminal offense. And you can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Much of the coverage centered on whether Trump genuinely believed he had won. This framing turned an act of extortion into a psychological curiosity. Whether Trump believed he won is irrelevant to whether he tried to coerce a public official into falsifying election results.</p><p><strong>2018-2019: \u201cRat\u201d and \u201cWatch father-in-law\u201d</strong></p><p>When Michael Cohen began cooperating with federal investigators, Trump launched a public pressure campaign using language that could have come straight from a mob movie.</p><p>He called Cohen a \u201c<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-cohen-rat/story?id=59862349\">rat</a>\u201c repeatedly on Twitter. In ordinary usage, a person who exposes wrongdoing is a whistleblower or a witness. In organized crime, they\u2019re a rat. Then came the threat: Trump tweeted about Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, suggesting investigators should \u201ctake a look\u201d at him. Keep talking, and your family will suffer consequences.</p><p>Cohen delayed his congressional testimony as a result, with his lawyer <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/michael-cohen-says-trump-s-threats-against-his-family-will-n961816\">explicitly citing</a> \u201congoing threats against his family from President Trump.\u201d The witness intimidation worked, at least temporarily. Media coverage framed these episodes as \u201cTwitter feuds\u201d or \u201cTrump lashing out.\u201d Just another day, just another tweet.</p><p>Same technique every time. State the threat, build in the deniability, let the target understand what you really mean while giving reporters enough ambiguity to write a \u201cbalanced\u201d story. It worked on Zelensky. It didn\u2019t work on Raffensperger, but only because he refused to play along. It worked on Cohen, at least for a while.</p><p>And it\u2019s working now, on Denmark and the European allies who heard \u201cwe will remember\u201d and understood exactly what that means.</p><h4><strong>Why this keeps happening</strong></h4><p>If you\u2019ve read this far, you might be wondering how this is still possible. Trump has been a public figure for decades. The \u201cmob boss\u201d framing has been written about extensively. Prosecutors, former FBI directors, linguists, and organized crime experts have all pointed to the dynamic. And yet, every time Trump delivers another threat wrapped in a denial, newsrooms dutifully print the denial as the headline.</p><p>Part of the answer is structural. Journalism, as a profession, is biased toward coherence. When a reporter covers a speech, their job is to produce a story that makes sense to readers. If a political figure rambles for an hour, veering between conspiracy theories, personal grievances, and the occasional policy fragment, the reporter can\u2019t just transcribe the chaos. They have to find the signal in the noise, identify the \u201cnewsworthy\u201d bits, construct a narrative. This is usually a good instinct. Most political speech benefits from distillation. But when the chaos is itself the message, when the incoherence and menace are the point, this filtering process becomes a form of distortion.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2024/sanewashing-meaning-donald-trump-journalists/\">Kelly McBride at Poynter</a> described one version of this problem: journalists have an impulse to make things easier for news consumers. That\u2019s fine when you\u2019re translating economic jargon from the Federal Reserve chair. It\u2019s a disaster when you\u2019re trying to make sense of something that was never meant to be sensible.</p><p>There\u2019s also the fear of appearing biased and the sheer problem of volume. In a polarized environment, outlets are terrified of being accused of taking sides. Accurately describing Trump\u2019s rhetoric as threatening or authoritarian invites accusations of partisan overreach, even when the description is factually supported by the transcript. So editors soften the language. Meanwhile, Trump says so many outrageous things that any single statement struggles to break through. <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/donald-trump/major-news-outlets-gave-much-less-coverage-trumps-vermin-attack-then-they-did-clintons\">A Media Matters study found</a> that Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d comment in 2016 received 18 to 29 times more coverage than Trump\u2019s \u201cvermin\u201d speech in 2023, in which he pledged to \u201croot out\u201d political opponents who \u201clive like vermin within the confines of our country.\u201d One candidate\u2019s verbal stumble became a defining campaign moment. The other candidate\u2019s explicit dehumanization of his enemies barely registered.</p><p>Political scientist Brian Klaas has a term for this: \u201c<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-election-rallies-facts-kamala-harris-e906e990b5dcfe44b5e672336fe82b32\">the banality of crazy</a>.\u201d Things that would be disqualifying scandals for any other politician have become background noise for Trump. Each threat that gets normalized makes the next one easier to dismiss.</p><p>And underneath all of this is a category error that newsrooms have never fully corrected. Political journalism is built to cover people who are operating within a shared framework of democratic norms. The conventions of the beat assume good faith: politicians may spin, they may exaggerate, they may mislead, but they\u2019re fundamentally playing the same game as everyone else. Trump isn\u2019t playing that game. He\u2019s operating in a different register entirely, one where threats are leverage, where denials are cover, where the whole point is to communicate menace while maintaining deniability. When you bring a \u201cboth sides\u201d framework to a protection racket, you end up printing the denial and burying the threat.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2024/10/08/media-sanewashing-trump-voters-misinformation-election\">Michael Tomasky, in an interview with WBUR</a>, made a point worth emphasizing: this is not a conspiracy. Reporters and editors are not colluding with Trump to make him look better. The sanewashing happens because the normal conventions of political journalism do not account for a candidate who refuses to operate within \u201ca certain pattern and a certain norm.\u201d The system is designed for a different kind of politician, and it breaks down when confronted with someone like Trump.</p><p>But the fact that the failure is structural rather than intentional doesn\u2019t make it less damaging. Every headline that privileges the denial over the threat is a small act of misinformation. Every story that treats \u201cI won\u2019t use force\u201d as the news, rather than \u201cI reminded everyone that I could use unstoppable force,\u201d contributes to a distorted picture of reality. Readers who rely on mainstream coverage encounter a version of Trump that has been sanded down, made palatable, rendered comprehensible within frameworks that don\u2019t apply to him.</p><p>Meanwhile, anyone who watches the actual speech, or reads the full transcript, sees something entirely different. The gap between the raw material and the coverage is where the sanewashing lives.</p><div><hr/></div><p><em>For those who would like to financially support The Present Age on a non-Substack platform, please be aware that I also publish these pieces to my Patreon.</em></p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://patreon.com/parkermolloy\"><span>Parker's Patreon</span></a></p><div><hr/></div><h4><strong>The audience that gets it</strong></h4><p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s striking about Davos: the people in that room understood what was happening. European leaders, diplomats, the foreign press. They didn\u2019t need anyone to explain that \u201cwe will remember\u201d was a threat. They didn\u2019t need a linguistics professor to parse \u201cunless I decide to use excessive strength.\u201d They heard it. They reported it. They\u2019re acting accordingly.</p><p>Carney called it a \u201crupture.\u201d Macron talked about \u201cbullies\u201d and the collapse of international law. Denmark\u2019s foreign minister had to publicly thank Trump for not invading. These are not people who saw the speech and came away reassured by the \u201cI won\u2019t use force\u201d line. They saw through the denial to the threat beneath it, because that\u2019s what the threat was designed to make them do.</p><p>The only audience that seems to keep getting it wrong is the American media, which continues to treat Trump\u2019s words as if they were uttered by a normal politician operating within normal constraints. The international community is responding to reality. American headlines are responding to the version of reality that Trump has constructed for them, the one where the denial is the story and the threat is just color.</p><p>This gap has consequences. When allies start making contingency plans for a post-American world, when they begin building institutions that route around Washington, when they start treating the United States as a threat rather than a partner, American readers should understand why. But they won\u2019t, if all they see is \u201cTrump seeks negotiations.\u201d</p><p>At Davos, Trump told reporters exactly how they would cover his speech. \u201cNow everyone\u2019s saying \u2018Oh, good,\u2019\u201d he said, mocking the relief that would follow his pro forma denial. He predicted the sanewashing. He announced it. He practically dared them not to do it.</p><p>And then everyone said, \u201cOh, good.\u201d</p>",

Expect better analytics this year. He also hinted an open API might be on the horizon.</li>\n<li><strong>To Video or Not to Video:\u00a0 </strong>Exaggerating for effect, Clanon said you should either do all video or none. My take: make video your primary focus, or keep it as an occasional dabble.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimal Post Frequency</strong>:\u00a0 3-5 times a week</li>\n<li><strong>He\u2019s Killing the \u201cFormula\u201d </strong>:\u00a0 The tired post format of hook, personal story, bulleted list and call to action will be de-prioritized.\u00a0 Clanon wants all types of posts, from one-liners to deep insight, to thrive on LinkedIn.</li>\n<li><strong>Pods</strong>: LinkedIn sounds serious about de-emphasizing pods, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>INSDE THE BELLY OF THE BEAST</strong></h3>\n<p>I also had a chance to chat with Mr Beast\u2019s head of channel @Will Fowler, and his commercial counterpart @Beau Avril about how commerce and creative collaborate on Beast videos.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Treat Integrations as Content:</strong> Brand deals are part of the story arc, not a sponsorship interrupt. Brands get pulled in early, but integrations must elevate the episode and protect retention. Best examples (Starbucks in \u201c30 Days in the Sky,\u201d DoorDash in \u201c100 Days on a Jet\u201d) work because the brand solves a real problem aligned with the premise. Also, it helps that Jimmy genuinely gets excited about brand partners.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideas Come from Anywhere</strong>: Often via a 3 a.m. call from Jimmy. They quickly vet concepts via title and thumbnail development, then move into a hard feasibility phase that weighs timeline, build complexity, and even whether the science exists to support the premise (90 Days in Space, for example, requires SpaceX to step up).</p>\n<p><strong>Time Rules:</strong> Shoots can run 30\u2013100 days, with teams filming nearly nonstop. Roughly four episodes are in production at any time, scaling to seven soon, which likely means external help.</p>\n<p><strong>Strong Advice</strong>: Creators should explain their audience\u2019s unique value to brands. Brands should stop over-engineering and trust creators to keep them native to the story.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SUPERFANS BEAT FOLLOWERS\u00a0</h3>\n<p>I loved the discussion with @Abby Ho, @Sara Wilson, and @Jo Burford about the move from scale to trust.</p>\n<p>They argued we\u2019ve shifted from the social graph to an AI-driven interest graph, where having a million followers doesn\u2019t mean a million people see you. I\u2019d take it one step further: AI is pushing us from the interest graph to the trust graph, meaning who we trust and where and how to we connect.</p>\n<p>Followers are losing power as a metric. Distribution is becoming identity-based relevance. Sharing happens more in DMs and private groups than public feeds. But these niche groups aren\u2019t necessarily small.\u00a0 Instead, they are focused and specific.</p>\n<p>Best advice?
