      "bodyText": "<h1>0.0 Context Setting</h1>\n<p>Tuesday, 20 January 2026 in Portland, Oregon, where it is cold, but not as cold as other places in the country. Apparently there were visible aurora last night, but I was too busy being asleep. </p>\n<p>A long one, today.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>1.0 Some Things That Caught My attention</h1>\n<h1>1.1 The Collapse of Form</h1>\n<p>I was reading Paul Musgrave\u2019s newsletter of today<sup id=\"fnref:musgrave\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:musgrave\">1</a></sup> on amongst other things the Mark Carney-saying-out-loud that the old international world order is dead, that Trump has kicked them all over, and that it\u2019s time for the rest of the world to deal with an antagonistic and yet still fairly predictable and dangerous toddler. (Predictable in the sense that he\u2019s capricious and in it for himself, and like I wrote elsewhere, exceedingly goal-oriented and method-agnostic).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I ended up reading Musgrave\u2019s issue on the decline (or collapse?) of the literate society<sup id=\"fnref:literate\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:literate\">2</a></sup>, and it put a few things into clear perspective for me. Here\u2019s what caught my attention:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A speedy dismissal of the \u201cadults have always complained about kids since the days of Socrates\u201d due to the specificity and consistency of current complaints/issues;</li>\n<li>the difference (and here I trust Musgrave) between a class where 70% of the students have done 50% of the reading and what\u2019s alleged to be the current situation of 20% of students having done 10% of the reading;</li>\n<li>what the decline of print culture \u201creally means\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have written <strong>a lot</strong> over the past 25 years about the collapse of form of content due to digitization. It feels weird to have written about it over the last 25 years and to then watch it happen, participate in it happening, and also see the results of the collapse of form not just in children and young people in general, but <em>in my own children</em>. </p>\n<p>So this is less of a new-thing-that-caught-my-attention and more of a oh, another thing I\u2019ll put in my confirmation bias bucket about how I feel good about an insightful observation.</p>\n<p>If you were born before, say, 1985, you were educated in and came of age in a thoroughly print/literate society. What Musgrave put clearly was this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At some point, I and many people my age must have been taught the difference between a book written by a single author and an edited volume; this is now knowledge I will be working into my lesson plans<sup id=\"fnref2:literate\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:literate\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and another example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Print literacy assumed and facilitated conversation; it also developed familiarity with the conventions of a literate society \u2014 that is, a society in which a dominant, even a predominant, stratum was aware, if sometimes only implicitly, of distinctions now lost, such as the difference between a tabloid and a broadsheet or between a pulp and a textbook. (In my recent experience, students no longer reliably process the pagination and layout of textbooks as helpful or as conveying hierarchies or cues about how to read them \u2014 rather, many struggle with how to navigate textbooks, as they have not often been exposed to them.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is simultaneously fascinating and to a degree, horrifying because of what I think is undeniably a collapse, just due to the speed in which the change has happened.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t really think about or understand what <em>literacy</em> meant in terms of common understanding in a society, or how <em>literacy</em> played a fundamental part of the societies in which I grew up. What I <em>thought</em> it meant, naively, was \u201cbeing able to read and understand things\u201d, but you can drive a truck through \u201cthings\u201d and \u201cunderstand\u201d. </p>\n<p>The key there is common understanding, or at least some degree of common understanding. I\u2019ve written before about somehow knowing the difference between a tabloid newspaper and a broadsheet newspaper, and that this isn\u2019t something you\u2019re explicitly taught in the way that you\u2019re sat down one day and your parents or educators teach you about editorial intent, business model, and how they interact with for historical reasons the size of paper on which news is printed. </p>\n<p>No, what this helped make clear was that (duh) we\u2019re shaped by a literate society, and after a while, the shaping of a literate society means that due to common understanding, we can take shortcuts. Shortcuts like \u201ca serif font is more trustworthy than a san serif font\u201d. You are the fish that\u2019s swimming in water, doesn\u2019t know what water is, and unless you pay a lot of attention, you might not notice what literacy is doing to, or for, you. </p>\n<p>But if you\u2019ve been reading this for a while, then you\u2019ll know where I\u2019m going here. </p>\n<p>Digitization is the ultimate collapse of form. For reasons of economics (i.e. storage and processing capacity), taking information and reducing it into a form that can be stored, manipulated, and retransmitted by computers involved breaking that information down to, well, its Shannon bones<sup id=\"fnref:shannon\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:shannon\">3</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>It is, like they say, just ones and zeros at the end of it. That would get you started.</p>\n<p>Musgrave points out that a literate society discovered, created, and then built itself around a whole bunch of affordances that could rely on a shared experience: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>students no longer reliably process the pagination and layout of textbooks as helpful or as conveying hierarchies or cues about how to read them \u2014 rather, many struggle with how to navigate textbooks, as they have not often been exposed to them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now this isn\u2019t to say that print design practices to show information hierarchy are sort of inherently baked into our brains, a sort of Chomsky-esque hierachy-detection-device. But it is to say that a bunch of emergent standards, well, emerged to create shortcuts, like I mentioned above.</p>\n<p>There are distinctions that exist in knowledge that I think were reflected in physical media, yes sometimes out of physical constraints, but also perhaps due to the underlying information and its structure itself. I imagine there are a bunch of library information science graduates reading this shaking their heads at my reckons here. </p>\n<p>Another example here is the story about <em>kids these days</em> not knowing what filesystems are and instead throwing everything into the Google Drive blender and just searching for things. That <em>works</em>, yes, but is it helpful in terms of organization? Could more explicit organization -- folders! anything else! -- be more helpful in helping keep track of information and keep track of understanding? This isn\u2019t me just doing a <em>god I wish kids these days would use folders</em>, it\u2019s as much a reflection on Google\u2019s <em>opinion</em> that may have been a result of business strategy that <em>search</em> is the best way to do things, and it just so happens that search (or, rather advertising based on search intent) is Google\u2019s bread and butter. </p>\n<p>There is a whole part here where cognitive psychologists might chime in about how we think and the structure of our brains makes us predisposed to, what, understand? certain types of information certain forms more easily, whether you want to go into the (discredited?) theory of learning styles or not. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve written before about how the feed collapsed the distinctions between the <em>kind</em> of media that people grew up with, a sort of unintentional confusion. </p>\n<p>Facebook was one example of this when links and content were introduced into the feed -- by design, the information in a feed was more or less undifferentiated. Make the feed easy to use. Make it clean. Make Facebook the important thing, not the information coming from external sources. </p>\n<p>This was also technically easy, of course. It would be more difficult to present, say, the NY Times differently than the NY Post in someone\u2019s feed, unless you were rendering say the information as an image (of which! more storage! more expensive!)</p>\n<p>Change is happening from two positions, here: those who grew up with shortcuts lost them and had to adapt. The shortcuts you\u2019re used to from a lifetime of a literate society and the forms and frames of such a society have been blown away, creating the opportunity for in some respects disguise and trickery. Too expensive for you to create a physical broadsheet newspaper? Well with internet publishing you can <em>look</em> like a broadsheet newspaper now.  </p>\n<p>Then from the other end, the creation of new forms, new shortcuts, new affordances at breakneck speed, to which Musgrave alludes to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is specifically that assignments and examinations that functioned well within the span of a few years are no longer feasible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>by which I interpret to mean that assignments and examinations created within and assuming knowledge of the common understanding affordances of a literate society could no longer rely on that common knowledge and understanding. You can imagine in this way the combination of cheap mobile computing and connectivity a sort of cultural K-T extinction event that within a decade had eaten away at or wiped out a whole method of understanding in replace of a new one, and a new one that was under economic pressure to win, as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>My position is that we\u2019ve undoubtedly lost something. Whether what\u2019s replacing/outcompeting that literate society is <em>better</em> or not is I think still out for the jury. It\u2019s certainly different, and the literate institutions -- those institutions that were created within and designed to assume that literate common understanding -- are clearly not capable of adapting quickly enough. </p>\n<p>This is to say nothing of the effects of generative AI. If you are going to say \u201cwell, generative AI lets us do what we could do with Photoshop for years anyway\u201d then you are wrong and you need to learn why<sup id=\"fnref:why\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:why\">4</a></sup>. It is now easier than it ever was to make a thing <em>look</em> (or sound, or read, or so on) like another thing. Style transfer itself is already more than, what, five years old? When I say \u201ceasier than it ever was\u201d, that undersells it: it is now trivial and ultimately accessible to anyone who wants to.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? It means another perspective to look at digital natives for one, a concept that I think is easily (and sometimes willfully) misunderstood. We could now look at digital natives as those who have grown up predominantly with digital forms of content (whatever they are), and on aggregate lack the common understanding of physical literate forms (like Musgrage\u2019s example, the fact that \u201cjournals\u201d exist with issues an volumes).</p>\n<p>But one attribute of those digital natives is that they understand that forms are malleable. In fact, forms may not be trustable <em>at all</em> seeing as exactly how malleable they are in the first place. I (and others) make jokes about the Star Trek episode where the Enterprise encounters tamarians, who speak only in metaphor<sup id=\"fnref:darmok\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:darmok\">5</a></sup> (\u201cShaka, when the walls fell\u201d, \u201cTemba, his arms wide!\u201d, Darmak and Jalad at Tanagra\u201d), and their parallels to memes and image macros, the rapid spread of shared understanding, a sort of gestalt around the combination of an image from popular culture (or an image <em>of</em> popular culture) and corresponding text. </p>\n<p>Are image memes rich in meaning? I\u2019d say so. Are they like poems? No, they\u2019re different. But do they share common intent to convey feeling? I think so. </p>\n<p>But now we have, at speed, a sort of shattered Babel of shared understanding that also stems from a shattering and re-forming of form. </p>\n<p>Again, another example: <em>what is a podcast</em>? What is the form of a podcast? Is it a piece of audio, accessible by an RSS feed? Is it two or more people discussing something? Is it two or more people discussing something on video? is it two or more people discussing something on video that can only be accessed on Spotify and not in a podcast app? Is it something that can only be played back through a Podcast app? Is it audio visual content that can be accessed on Netflix, and Netflix only, but still retains. conversational format? Is it allowed to include editing? Is it allowed to include indoor locations as well as outdoor locations? </p>\n<p>And then what does it mean if some content comes from a podcast? Does that mean it was cheap to produce? Does that mean it was produce independently? What does it mean to be produced independently? When I say I learned or heard of something from a podcast, how trustable do you think that information is? Do you need to know who hosted it? Could you guess at how trustable or accurate the information was from just the name alone and the fact that I listened to a podcast? </p>\n<p>That\u2019s to say nothing of the branding of form, either. What\u2019s a newsletter? What is a Substack? One intent of branding is to create an emotional connection and to set some sort of definition and expectation. How is a Substack [sic] different from a newsletter, and if I tell you I read something from a Substack as opposed to a newsletter, what does that mean to you?</p>\n<p>Did you know that a <em>tumblr</em> is a form? That a <em>gif</em> means something different than a meme? What does a TikTok versus a Reel versus a Story mean?</p>\n<p>All of these are malleable forms that have been <em>designed</em>. Their constraints are different that literate media, but constraints exist nonetheless. Portrait versus vertical formats still exist. Pixel density exists, or used to exist. Website versus app exists, hell, the platform upon which a form exists makes a difference, whether from the OS level through to whether Netflix or Spotify or Facebook or Libby or Kindle is a platform.</p>\n<p>It used to be that I could tell, physically, if I were need the end of a novel. There would be fewer pages left. It used to be that I could tell if I were near the end of an ebook because my percentage read indicator (not! the page number, another loss of shared reference point, replaced by, what, \u201clocation\u201d) would be at what, 98%. But now 98% doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m near the end. Now 85% might mean I\u2019m near the end because the cheapness of storage and transmission means that it\u2019s trivial from a technical \u201cpublishing\u201d point of view for a publisher to include a few thousand words of teaser for the next novel in the series. So now I\u2019m not nearly finished of the book, of the ebook, but I\u2019m nearly finished of the story that I paid for, that\u2019s encapsulated in a digital file that still mimics due to affordances and expectations the holdover of people who grew up with and understand books.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some drama that caught my attention, I swear it\u2019s related. The other day, some guy with a big Twitter account complained that on Bluesky, he was getting way less \u201cengagement\u201d than the equivalent post on X. He bemoaned that if Bluesky\u2019s intent was to become the next global townsquare then it was failing, and it would never achieve its goal. So like I\u2019ve done before, I blithely posted that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Global townsquares considered harmful at this stage of humanity\u2019s development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which is another way of rehashing the context collapse argument and conversation, which is another way of pointing out that \u201cwe\u201d lack shared understanding to the extent that platforms big enough (e.g. the EU\u2019s Very Large Online Platforms, those with over 45 million users in the EU) do not have users with enough shared understanding to not, essentially, get in big fucking fights the entire time, short of genuinely world-spanning events like, I don\u2019t know <em>football</em> or the Olympics and even then, not really.  </p>\n<p>Tom Carden then helpfully pointed me towards Herbert Dreyfus\u2019s book On The Internet<sup id=\"fnref:dreyfus\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:dreyfus\">6</a></sup>, of which he helpfully quoted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the vision of a worldwide electronic agora precisely misses the Kierkegaardian point that the people talking to each other in the Athenian agora were members of a direct democracy who were directly affected by the issues they were discussing, and, most importantly, the point of the discussion was for them to take the responsibility and risk of voting publicly on the questions they were debating. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Kierkegaard, a worldwide electronic agora is an oxymoron. The Athenian agora is precisely the opposite of the public sphere, where anonymous electronic kibitzers from all over the world, who risk nothing, come together to announce and defend their opinions. As an extension to the deracinated public sphere, the electronic agora is a grave danger to real political community. Kierkegaard enables us to see that the problem is not that Rheingold's 'electronic agora' is too utopian; it is not an agora at all, but a nowhere place for anonymous nowhere people. As such, it is dangerously distopian.\u201d<sup id=\"fnref2:dreyfus\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://newsletter.danhon.com/rss#fn:dreyfus\">6</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s a long paragraph. I believe in you, you can finish it.</p>\n<p>What Dreyfus is getting across is one aspect of our so-called global town squares or agoras, that they fundamentally lack a sense of accountability. It is different if you turn up to a town square and nobody knows who you are. (You could make an argument, I suppose, that <em>doxxing</em> is a backlash or some sort of attempt to actually get to an agora by instituting accountability to one\u2019s words, but then that doxxing is invariably used towards a purpose of, well, mob justice)</p>\n<p>But the Athenian agoras weren\u2019t just about accountability, they were about taking <em>the responsibility and risk of voting publicly on the questions they were debating</em>. What shared questions are being debated? The colour of the dress? Is this entertaining? Sure. Helpful? I mean to the extent that it\u2019s a lesson into the variability of the human experience and how what we perceive isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there, the science lesson that colours don\u2019t really exist? (Which I imagine can be felt like a universe-ending existential threat calling everything you hold dear into question).</p>\n<p>\u201cSmaller\u201d groups of people, sure. Groups that coalesce around forms, sure. At least Star Trek fans have previous series  to coalesce around when they decide to be the best at hating the newest iteration of the franchise. </p>\n<p>So I\u2019m not worried in the sense that forms are being destroyed and new ones are being created. Creating the new ones is exciting! That we\u2019re creating the new ones without potentially applying what we\u2019ve learned before is disappointing but not surprising. What I am worried about is the difference between the two, the phase change between what was and what is now, and then what will come after. Computing I think means there\u2019s nothing stopping malleability of form. Someone posted the other day a portable Sony video editing rig that looked like exactly the kind of thing that you\u2019d use for a couple of decades during the heyday of electronic newsgathering. I don\u2019t know, miniDV ingest on one end, some quick editing on the rig before squirting the DV files elsewhere for broadcast. Now it\u2019s Capcut on a phone, or Da Vinci for a video essay. (What <em>is</em> a video essay?) Or whatever\u2019s used to create MasterClass videos, or Veritasium videos, or what have you.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s a world where there\u2019s less and less shared understanding? I don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s less shared understanding, to be honest, versus rapidly reconfiguring shared understanding that surfaces and then drowns to be remade again, form and content both. </p>\n<p>All I know is that when my kids found out about what a phone directory was, and why it existed in the time of a lack of search, they thought it made sense as was a pretty good idea. So there\u2019s that, at least.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>OVER THREE THOUSAND WORDS THIS TIME. I don\u2019t know about you, but four times looks like a trend. I shall try to subvert it next time.</p>\n<p>How have you been?</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Dan</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Let\u2019s get you shipping</h2>\n<p>Aside from my <a href=\"https://www.verylittlegravitas.com\" target=\"_blank\">regular consulting</a>, I also do <a href=\"https://www.verylittlegravitas.com/how-people-work\" target=\"_blank\">team workshops</a> and individual <a href=\"https://www.verylittlegravitas.com/how-people-work/coaching\" target=\"_blank\">coaching</a> based on the workshop curriculum.

The line between fact and fantasy continues to blur, but when reality is this negotiable, the soil for preferred futures is fertile. <em>You can just do things.</em> What\u2019s the future you want to see? Making reclaims agency amidst lost meaning. So, don\u2019t escape this reality \u2014 design the one you want. We desperately need your alternatives.</p><h4><strong>Literally make anything real with <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/?channel=youtube&amp;subchannel=substack&amp;source=zine&amp;campaign=crossplatform&amp;subcampaign=substack&amp;utm_medium=youtube&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_content=zine&amp;utm_campaign=crossplatform&amp;utm_term=substack\">-10% off</a> any site.

Squeeze your brand inside a palatable vessel of any meme or moment.</p><p>Sustaining this game of trend train jumping requires scale (i.e. an abundance of talent, money, infrastructure, etc.) and extreme commitment. You have to be \u201calways on.\u201d But, as many know, this has psychic consequences, and few can maintain this pace without becoming damaged. Companies which build out this capability can theoretically overcome this challenge, but when it comes to <em>responding</em>, those resources get in the way.</p><p>As an alternative, many are inclined to uphold \u201cradical authenticity\u201d as their strategy for resonance. Rather than chasing, <em>stay the course</em>. Never posture. Tell it as it is. But this approach is <em>also</em> problematic. If you adamantly believe in \u201cradical authenticity,\u201d you\u2019ve likely built a business on a mimetic cycle \u2013 your business took off when people assumed each other\u2019s desires as a collective and toward a viewpoint an organization already held. Perhaps you may have even <em>inspired</em> this cycle. Or maybe you just got lucky. But if we know anything about memetic cycles, desires flip eventually.</p><p>And so, if you\u2019re going to take this posture of \u201cauthenticity,\u201d then you must have the appetite to refuse growth when growth makes itself available. This requires a stiff backbone, and most, if not <em>all</em> of businesses that take this route stay small or crash hard.</p><h4>So what\u2019s an organization to do? Either chase what\u2019s hot indefinitely until burnout, or nobly reject growth and sustained relevance on a doomed quest for authenticity?</h4><h4>There\u2019s a secret third posture:</h4><h4><em>Propriety</em>.</h4><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y9wP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdcc839e-9080-4a13-9717-8380202d86f7_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y9wP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdcc839e-9080-4a13-9717-8380202d86f7_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Our society has shunned \u201cpropriety\u201d \u2013 a word often infused with morality.

Sure there\u2019s value in speed, but if you don\u2019t understand timing, speed for speed\u2019s sake will result in a total loss of value. How may we slow things down so we can get a better sense of when strategies, words and participation is most appropriate?</p><p>A sommelier would never chug Domaine Romanee-Conti (DRC), a legendary French producer. For every wine, there\u2019s a whole process of observation, smelling and swirling before the first sip. While the effects of alcohol are certainly part of the enjoyment, the true benefits come from understanding, savoring, and timing the consumption.</p><p>With most things now, we mostly measure \u201cefficiency\u201d or the speed at which we become drunk. But if everything is about speed, <em>now</em> is the time to slow things down.</p><p>In <em>Culture is our Business</em>, Marshall McLuhan observed:</p><blockquote><p><em>\u201cArt is new perception. New art opens new worlds for our recognition and nourishment. Psychically, art is valuable only when new. Commercially, new art is kooky and worthless. The gap between the kooky and the commercially valuable is closing fast.\u201d</em></p></blockquote><h4>Paradoxically, the illegible is where value is created.</h4><p>Value emerges when we have to strive to understand meaning and truth. But now, the speed of conversion to commercial value is <em>instantaneous</em>. The metaphorical DRC is in our mouths immediately, without any processing, appreciating, learning, or pairing. The \u201cnew\u201d is absorbed and digested in a thumb-swipe, while the new language forming around it (i.e. memes, commentary, and content), is remixed and consumed just as fast. Novelty is digitally digested, digitally judged, and its value is consumed through our digitally extended senses.</p><p>But this speed is incomplete.</p><p>If you create something new, and you know it\u2019s valuable, slow down. This could be as simple as a new feature, product line, variation, or collab. It could be a new article or a film. It could even be a new campaign to an old thing. But if you\u2019re going to ship, consider releasing it in bits. People need to feel like they\u2019re missing something... <em>because they are.</em></p><h4>A digital perspective is an incomplete perspective.</h4><p>People haven\u2019t actually grappled with \u201cthe thing\u201d itself, they\u2019ve encountered a mere <em>phantasm</em>, which they accept as the \u201creal thing.\u201d Therefore, to assess the (real) value, they\u2019ll need to spend (real) time with the thing. And so, the slower you go, the longer the value cycle is.</p><p>This might feel frustrating because, <em>ughh time</em>... but if you try to speed up the cycle of capitalization, you risk incurring a false sense of having absorbed value when you or the consumer hasn\u2019t. Friction is invaluable and why we hear it discussed so frequently today.</p><p>Find a way to slow down absorption and increase the savoring. In our increasingly digitized and seamless world, this is hard. But less is more. Make mysteries to be solved. Scatter breadcrumbs. Keep secrets. The \u201cfidelity\u201d of information needs to be so low that people spend more time making sense of things by filling in the gaps on their own, or by hunting down the missing pieces themselves. <em>They will</em>. Consider our infatuation with true crime, conspiracy and fan theories, easter eggs, and fanfic. \u201cGritty over pretty\u201d to quote Marshall McLuhan\u2019s grandson Andrew.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HmHx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F948d98e8-1852-4222-984d-aa4ae8797911_1920x1080.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HmHx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F948d98e8-1852-4222-984d-aa4ae8797911_1920x1080.jpeg\" style=\"\" width=\"1456\"/><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Consider: the digital channel should do the <em>exact opposite</em> of what we have all been optimizing it to do.

But larger, they create <em>an environment</em> for all to deepen <em>their</em> appreciation and sense of wonder. They give people the space to explore, to try things they would have never tried, to appreciate nuance and craft, and to receive the maximum enjoyment (i.e. value) out of an experience.</p><p>Like a somm\u2019s table or tasting room, we need to create \u201cspaces\u201d for people to engage with the real. These enclaves should strive to include an embodied component.</p><p>Enclaves that encourage curiosity open people up for personal engagement. Within enclaves, people witness others doing the same. Consider offering people the infrastructure, attention, and encouragement to relate and document their own personal experiences with reality.</p><p>We\u2019ve already touched upon a few ways to build enclaves: spark curiosity through mystery, and play with secrets. Bring back je ne sais quoi (\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u201d), not for the purpose of self-glorification, but to show people there\u2019s something more you\u2019ve encountered that they have not yet. Consider poetry, which requires more involvement and work to understand. Invite participation.

It\u2019s more likely they interacted with a phantasm. Most people would rather be handed phantasms than attempt to create their own. Instead, find ways to spark their curiosity.</p><p>The co-curious always find each other, and especially if you set the table for them to interact (meet-ups, events, websites, forums, social media, physical spaces, stores, pop-ups, etc.).</p><p>Encourage them to experiment, to push beyond what they\u2019ve attempted before. Don\u2019t over explain. Let work speak for itself. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to provide the \u201cscaffolding\u201d (in an educational sense, prompts, queues, and tools), but don\u2019t construct the whole thing. The goal is to help people progress to the point of having <em>agency</em> around the thing. This is McLuhan\u2019s \u201ccoolness\u201d or lack of fidelity.
