Google\u2019s NotebookLM helped kick this off, but now top creators, startups, and established media companies are leaning in.</p>\n<p>Inception Point AI, for example, says it has produced 200,000 episodes, claiming that at times its shows accounted for 1% of all podcasts released in a given week. Steven Bartlett is using AI to create more content for his podcast fans. And The Washington Post is creating \u201cYour Personal Podcast\u201d to build podcasts tailored to each user\u2019s profile.</p>\n<p>These experiments are roundly criticized by traditional media, but they aren\u2019t going away. More from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/13/nx-s1-5641047/washington-posts-ai-podcast\">NPR</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-12/ai-podcasting-is-changing-industry\">LA Times</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"223\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.png?resize=206%2C223&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"206\"/></figure></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Rise of Biometric Algorithms</h3>\n<p>Social algorithms will start incorporating data from health trackers to deliver even more targeted recommendations, and more insidious ways to addict us to the feed.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll move beyond time-spent and click-throughs to heart-rate spikes and pupillary dilation. Some platforms may even push bio-integration to deliver interruption-free content (and yes, this could be how Western microdramas monetize).</p>\n<p>The consequences are wide-ranging:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Creators optimize for physical response, not just retention.</li>\n<li>\u201cPhysiological editing\u201d becomes a thing.</li>\n<li>Iron-clad vendor lock-in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, your body will betray you. Your \u201cI want educational podcasts\u201d goal will get steamrolled by biomarker evidence that you prefer rage-bait and AI slop.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png?resize=205%2C212&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"205\"/></figure></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From NPC to PC \u2013 the Rise of the Playable Creator</h3>\n<p>Back in 2004, we typed commands to a guy in a chicken suit (Subservient Chicken) and laughed because it gave us the illusion of control.</p>\n<p>Twenty-two years later, the chickens have come home to roost.</p>\n<p>Creators are starting to turn their lives into fan-controlled characters where it\u2019s not just \u201cdo a thing,\u201d but binding decisions, both mundane and macro, selected and paid for by doting fans. What to eat. When to sleep. Who to date.</p>\n<p>Fans will even control a creator\u2019s environment: thermostat, lighting, alarm clock, smartwatch. Creators who embrace this will outsource decision-making to their audience. Fans will relish controlling something, anything, in our topsy-turvy world.</p>\n<p>This voluntary dehumanization gives us Truman Show 2.0, where Truman is begging for donations and the audience is the director.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"205\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-4.png?resize=204%2C205&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"204\"/></figure></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Verification Vlogging</strong></h3>\n<p>Flesh and blood creators will increasingly opt for ways to prove they are human, not AI constructs<strong>. </strong>From the \u201cPlayable Creator\u201d to live streamed and IRL appearances, human markers explode.</p>\n<p>One creepy format that\u2019s already emerging is boredom content: creators sleeping, eating messy food, stumbling over words, and even sprinkling grammatical and spelling errors into their newsletters (some creators are already doing this\u2026 wink-wink).</p>\n<p>The world increasingly bifurcates:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Scalable, synthetic and corporate owned perfection.</li>\n<li>Messy, gross and error-prone humans.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-5.png?resize=192%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"192\"/></figure></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Life as a service</h3>\n<p>In 2026 and beyond, creators will realize their body and their voice are an asset class.</p>\n<p>Mid-tier creators will start licensing their deepfake rights so they can \u201cwork\u201d in multiple places at once. Brands will use recognizable creator likenesses as customer support reps, virtual store clerks, and region-specific ad characters.</p>\n<p>Voice becomes its own asset class too, as more companies follow ElevenLabs by licensing a creator\u2019s voice for separate AI avatars. When identity decouples from the physical person, creators become IP holding companies.</p>\n<p>The good news: it becomes easier to sell a channel.</p>\n<p>The downside: it multiplies key-person risk. What happens when your avatar goes off the rails and starts spewing racist or illegal nonsense?</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Related</strong>: Creators will sell customized AI versions of themselves to superfans, and platforms will try to muscle in on the revenue.</li>\n<li><strong>Related</strong>: Taken to its macabre extreme, we\u2019ll see creators \u201clive\u201d long beyond their lifespan. But who owns these forever identities, and how do you value them? We\u2019ll find out.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BONUS \u2013 FIVE MORE SIGNALS I\u2019M TRACKING</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"138\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/louderback.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-signals-Small.jpg?resize=560%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"\" width=\"560\"/></figure></div>\n<p><strong>Affiliate Links Vaporize: </strong>AI agents discover, bid, and buy products for consumers. When that happens, affiliate links get bypassed. It will be gradual, but it could rewrite purchase influence.</p>\n<p><strong>Scammer Crack-Down:</strong> The FTC and other watchdogs get serious about deepfake scams. Criminals stay two steps ahead, but enforcement improves.</p>\n<p><strong>The Rise of the Ozempic Creator</strong>: As GLP-1 weight loss drugs go mainstream the \u201cabundance aesthetic\u201d fades.\u00a0 Oprah is just the beginning Expect more precision nutrition, bio-compatible recipes, and chemically altered lifestyle content.</p>\n<p><strong>The Nose Knows:</strong> Olfactory computing tries to leave the lab. Again. Algorithmically triggered smells could become the next big creator-led revolution.\u00a0 Or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Who Are You?\u00a0 </strong>Better age and identity verification spreads. Pair that with global crackdowns on teens and social media, and you get new restrictions and new creator opportunities.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>SPONSOR</em></h2>\n<p>LinkedIn\u2019s <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/b2b-institute/easy-to-find-being-where-b2b-buying-happens\">new B2B Buyer Report</a> makes the case better than I ever could: buyers trust expert voices more than brands, and they spend most of their research time reading the people who actually understand the space. That\u2019s exactly my audience: marketers, media execs, founders, top creators and operators who shape budgets and make decisions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A weekly sponsorship puts your company inside a trusted, high-intent environment, shows up repeatedly where it actually matters, and aligns your brand with the point-of-view content buyers say moves them. If you want to speak to the people building the next wave of media, creators, and AI, this is where they show up every week.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Drop me an <a href=\"mailto:jim@louderback.com\">email</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ScSYOFx3aV0eKfKqqqA-JxV-ibrNbhufuNE2NbYFJk/edit?tab=t.0\">check out our sponsorship information here.</a></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1BFS  RECAP</h2>\n<p>The 1 Billion Followers Summit was a magical and amazing gathering of creators, execs, investors and platforms from around the world.\u00a0 My Economy track featured 120 speakers and 55 sessions across four stages, focusing on what\u2019s happening now, and what the future holds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some key takeaways:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CREATORS AND REPRESENTATION</strong></h3>\n<p>CAA top exec @Brent Weinstein and I sat down for a fireside chat exploring the new CAA Creators, where the industry is going and more.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what I learned:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Podcasting as Training Wheels:</strong> Traditional celebs have tried to enter the creator space with decidedly uneven results.\u00a0 Podcasting gives them a back door that makes the shift so much easier.\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Who\u2019s Afraid of the Big Bad Slop:</strong> Not Brent\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Sports Rises:</strong> Creators are embracing sports, and athletes are emerging as a powerful creator class. Huge growth area.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>LINKEDIN CHANGES AHEAD</strong></h3>\n<p>I talked with LinkedIn\u2019s head of creator product @Sam Carrao Clanon to get a peek into the future of the B2B platform.\u00a0 Key insights:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Analytics:</strong>\u00a0 LinkedIn knows creators need better data, and they can\u2019t do everything. Expect better analytics this year. He also hinted an open API might be on the horizon.</li>\n<li><strong>To Video or Not to Video:\u00a0 </strong>Exaggerating for effect, Clanon said you should either do all video or none. My take: make video your primary focus, or keep it as an occasional dabble.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimal Post Frequency</strong>:\u00a0 3-5 times a week</li>\n<li><strong>He\u2019s Killing the \u201cFormula\u201d </strong>:\u00a0 The tired post format of hook, personal story, bulleted list and call to action will be de-prioritized.\u00a0 Clanon wants all types of posts, from one-liners to deep insight, to thrive on LinkedIn.</li>\n<li><strong>Pods</strong>: LinkedIn sounds serious about de-emphasizing pods, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>INSDE THE BELLY OF THE BEAST</strong></h3>\n<p>I also had a chance to chat with Mr Beast\u2019s head of channel @Will Fowler, and his commercial counterpart @Beau Avril about how commerce and creative collaborate on Beast videos.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Treat Integrations as Content:</strong> Brand deals are part of the story arc, not a sponsorship interrupt. Brands get pulled in early, but integrations must elevate the episode and protect retention. Best examples (Starbucks in \u201c30 Days in the Sky,\u201d DoorDash in \u201c100 Days on a Jet\u201d) work because the brand solves a real problem aligned with the premise. Also, it helps that Jimmy genuinely gets excited about brand partners.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideas Come from Anywhere</strong>: Often via a 3 a.m. call from Jimmy. They quickly vet concepts via title and thumbnail development, then move into a hard feasibility phase that weighs timeline, build complexity, and even whether the science exists to support the premise (90 Days in Space, for example, requires SpaceX to step up).</p>\n<p><strong>Time Rules:</strong> Shoots can run 30\u2013100 days, with teams filming nearly nonstop. Roughly four episodes are in production at any time, scaling to seven soon, which likely means external help.</p>\n<p><strong>Strong Advice</strong>: Creators should explain their audience\u2019s unique value to brands. Brands should stop over-engineering and trust creators to keep them native to the story.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SUPERFANS BEAT FOLLOWERS\u00a0</h3>\n<p>I loved the discussion with @Abby Ho, @Sara Wilson, and @Jo Burford about the move from scale to trust.</p>\n<p>They argued we\u2019ve shifted from the social graph to an AI-driven interest graph, where having a million followers doesn\u2019t mean a million people see you. I\u2019d take it one step further: AI is pushing us from the interest graph to the trust graph, meaning who we trust and where and how to we connect.</p>\n<p>Followers are losing power as a metric. Distribution is becoming identity-based relevance. Sharing happens more in DMs and private groups than public feeds. But these niche groups aren\u2019t necessarily small.\u00a0 Instead, they are focused and specific.</p>\n<p>Best advice? Design your content and brand messaging for the \u201cOMG that\u2019s so me\u201d moment and you\u2019ll have a fan for life.\u00a0 \u00a0Stop marketing to communities and start building with them. The real risk isn\u2019t being too niche. It\u2019s being culturally irrelevant at scale.</p>\n<p>They also nailed the fandom trap: Show up late with slow activations, then show up wrong by not speaking the language. And beware overfeeding fandoms until they fatten up into manufactured affinity.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1BFS QUIBIS</h2>\n<p><strong>The \u201cCurse of Knowledge\u201d:</strong> Many creators fail to monetize because they assume everyone knows what they know. @Justin Mecham, founder of Creatyl, said what feels \u201cbasic\u201d to a creator often feels like \u201cmagic\u201d or \u201cwizardry\u201d to the audience.</p>\n<p><strong>LinkedIn\u2019s Content Deficit</strong>: @Vin Matano, CEO of CreatorBuzz shared that despite having over 1 billion users, only 1% of LinkedIn users create content, making it a massive \u201ccontent-deficient\u201d opportunity for influence and credibility.</p>\n<p><strong>The \u201c11th Episode\u201d Benchmark:</strong> In podcasting, explained Gautam Raj Anand, founder and CEO of Hubhopper, reaching the 11th episode puts a creator in the top 1% of podcasters globally due to the high rate of \u201cpodfading\u201d (quitting early).</p>\n<p><strong>On Audio</strong>: \u201cFood without taste is the equivalent of content without audio\u2026 video without audio and music is like empty calories.\u201d \u2014 @<em>Oscar H\u00f6glund, CEO of Epidemic Sound</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>On Branding:</strong> \u201cTrends are containers. They\u2019re not really the idea\u2026 The more you jump on trends, the less distinctive you will look.\u201d \u2014 @<em>Sara Zouad, CEO of Brand Builders</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>On Monetization</strong>: \u201cAs a creator, if you\u2019re solving people\u2019s problems, it\u2019s okay to make money\u2026 If you\u2019re not making crazy money as a creator, it\u2019s a hobby.\u201d \u2014 @<em>Justin Mecham, Founder of Creatyl</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>On Business Ownership:</strong> \u201cControl equals freedom. If you maintain control of your business at all times, you will always have the option of how you want to live.\u201d \u2014 <em>Tobi Oluwole, Founder of Magnate</em>.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OTHER 1BFS HOT TAKES</h2>\n<p><strong>Living the Fizz:</strong> @Sara Wilson shares her top 7 takeaways from 1BFS.\u00a0 She\u2019s spot on.\u00a0 (<a href=\"https://communitycatalysts.substack.com/p/7-patterns-from-dubai-that-should\">Community Catalysts</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Trust Rules:</strong> @Robb Montgomery with journalism-tinged takeaways.
